<h1 id="ChapMoralityTypes">Morality : categories</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has the following requirements :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="#ChapMoralityContext" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapMoralityContext">22</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated need for active reading: <span class="math inline"> ⋆  ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are many different kinds of moralities and those of two people can easily find themselves at odds with one another. This is especially true for local morality due, for example, to the tendency of enemies to align their moralities with their side of the conflict. My goal here is not to describe which kinds of moralities I favor, or even to discuss my own. Rather, I intend to describe what moralities usually do and to describe certain categories which I feel are important to the understanding of common moralities.<br />
A first important point is that not all moralities judge the same things. As I have said before, morality evaluate some ideas to decide whether they are good or bad, but not all ideas fall within the scope of morality. Murder feels entirely within the purview of morality whereas "the number 2" doesn’t. Well that scope (that purview) depends on the morality considered. Some only wish to judge actions, whereas others judge ideas or even objects directly.</p>
<p>I will not introduce any specific vocabulary for these differences. It is easy enough to say "the morality of A does not judge ideas of kind X".<br />
Certain (most) moralities use a notion of moral value for certain things. For example, a person might be considered good or bad but also be given a value, which is used for divers other judgments the morality might deliver. That is sometimes expressed by sentences such as "people are an end in themselves". My representation of that process is that these moralities actually use two ideas for a single entity X. One is the idea of X as an end, and one is the idea of X as an actor. Saying that the first one is good is equivalent to saying that X has a value. <a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Again I offer no specific vocabulary because I don’t believe it is needed.<br />
I will now describe some categories of moralities for future discussion. Of course, more often than not a given person morality doesn’t entirely fall within a category. Rather, the most common use should be to say that you have a morality that "mostly behaves like a morality of kind X".<br />
First category, effect based morality, also called "effective morality". The idea here is to restrict judgment to ideas that have an effect on reality, or rather to only judge ideas insofar as they have an effect on reality. <a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Most of the time, this means that an effective morality will not consider it bad of people to be a certain way, only to act a certain way. A person with a twisted mind that only produces good for the world would then be considered a good person. Variations can exist on the notion of effective morality depending on the view on the usually unclear notion of "cause and effect" one has. One might notably decide to judge something based on its past, future, or probable-in-absolute effects.</p>
<p>I leave a more complete study of that point to another time, or perhaps to someone else, if anyone is willing.<br />
Now let’s take a look at the difference between deontological and utilitarian moralities. <a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> This is mainly a difference between moralities that judge which choices are good and which are bad. Deontological morality uses the concept of action. It judges given actions (or more broadly decisions) and can consider something to be good or bad "in itself". To the contrary, utilitarian morality only consider effects and judges actions with respect to how they affect the world only. <a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> The word "utilitarian" refers to the notion of utility. The utility of X is the general notion of "what is good for X". It is a numerical value, the more X has utility, the better off he/she/it is. For a better explanation, refer to the field of game theory in which the word is often used.<br />
This then of course begs the question "what is a good impact on the world" ? Well you can’t just judge the resulting state, most utilitarian moralities judge an evolution of the world, not a state. Otherwise you have to consider not creating life as equivalent to murder, which seems silly. Hence, utilitarian moralities are about valuing sequences of evolution for the world. <a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Notably, I list the following cases of utilitarian morality.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Focused only on creating utility for the individuals currently alive.</p></li>
<li><p>Focused only on creating utility for the individuals that will end up existing.</p></li>
<li><p>Focused on the sum of total utility across time.</p></li>
<li><p>Considering an utility for the evolution of the world that isn’t only dependent on the utilities of the creatures within it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The notion of actions impacting the world can cause annoying issues regarding the complexity linked with the representation of the perspective of the human mind as an actor in the world. This is tied to what some call "decision theory" and on which I have not yet chosen a stance. Please note that everything above should be considered within the usual naive framework used for these things (see chapter <a href="#ChapBaseModel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapBaseModel">12</a>).<br />

<li id="fn75" role="doc-endnote"><p>This is but a representation, which can easily be changed without any impact on the description of the rest of the operations of a morality. As such, this isn’t really a theory but rather a way to describe things intuitively. Almost a form of information compression. Nevertheless, I suppose some discoveries regarding the way the human mind works could "prove me wrong".<a href="#fnref75" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn76" role="doc-endnote"><p>Again, I would like to remind the reader that when I speak of judging an idea here, I speak of the process that is commonly referred to as judging the thing which the idea depicts. So when you judge the idea of murder, one might say that you are just judging murder.<a href="#fnref76" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn77" role="doc-endnote"><p>yada yada, call it wogian deontology and wogian utilitarianism if needed.<a href="#fnref77" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn78" role="doc-endnote"><p>I am aware that nothing in that couple sentences prevents from considering utilitarian morality as a kind of deontological morality. I will thus clarify that a deontological morality assigns a value to the ideas of actions even without considering a context and the effects they will have.<a href="#fnref78" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn79" role="doc-endnote"><p>"The world" is used in this chapter as a general word for "reality", " the universe", or whichever similar notion you see fit to use. I am not particularly focused on the planet.<a href="#fnref79" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
