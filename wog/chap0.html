<h1 id="ChapIntro">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="a-few-words">A few words</h2>
<p>During the last few years, I was often forced to postpone interesting reflections on a large variety of subjects. Most of the time, I would think a little bit about these subjects, but I would end up frustrated by a lack of depth. Indeed, many topics of reflection require assumptions and previous work. Theses various questions and mysteries form a graph of interconnected subjects, which can mean that access to some of the "high level" questions can require quite a lot of preliminary answers. Of course, we traditionally approach questions (and situations even) from the paradigm of our basic stance on reality. It is, I would say, a mix of instinct, cultural standards of varying degrees of universality, and a pinch of personal variation. That is sufficient for many subjects such as "when are we eating ?" and "I wonder how cars work" but for more abstract, complex, or simply uncommon subjects I often found that when I wanted to dig deep into the meat of things I was inadequately prepared. In fact, even for questions such as the ones quoted above, I would wager that a better foundation of the paradigm used when thinking of an answer can be beneficial.</p>
<p>I have now managed to set some time aside to remedy to that lack of intellectual foundation. Sadly, my time isn’t infinite, and must still limit myself to arbitrary modelization when it comes to the fundamentals. My goal is to reach a better global state of understanding regarding what I consider important and the way I approach life and things in general. Hence, any hypothetical survey of all human thoughts on the topic of the nature of truth will have to wait. Some time was spent on the likes of that question, but I then had to move on. My goals are multiple and can, in broad lines, be summarized as follows :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide intellectual foundation to my understanding of my own intellectual paradigm</p></li>
<li><p>Partially rework said paradigm as needed</p></li>
<li><p>Rethink many of my protocols and ways to approach things</p></li>
<li><p>Observe how I tend to react to things, especially when it comes to my flaws</p></li>
<li><p>Gain a broader understanding of the way important things work</p></li>
<li><p>Give special attention that what others are and how to interact with them</p></li>
<li><p>Rethink my lifeplan</p></li>
<li><p>Spend some time on a few secondary subjects</p></li>
<li><p>Develop intellectual tools, especially vocabulary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is already a long list, and I do not have that much time. Less than a year in total. <span> Go back to commenting on that once the work is done</span><br />
I have now a comment to myself as a future reader. Others readers can feel free to read it, but they should know they are not the target audience. Said comment is confined to the next paragraph.<br />
Hey handsome, I love you. I used some prepa-like math to express ideas in some parts. At the time of writing, these are mostly the fundamental ones (I mean, the existing ones). Provided that you remember your training, you should understand. But I also used it to make nods and calls to a certain way to think things, from which you might have distanced yourself, especially where it comes to modelization. You hopefully know what I am talking (well writing (well typing)) about. I will let you handle those differences with your fancy future thinking, that was just a reminder. By the way, if you are wearing a hat now and it suit you : good for you, I never found one that was good to me. Doff it for a second will you, as a gesture to me. If you did : appreciated. If not : that’s fine too. Have a fantastic unit of time of your choosing (you can pick the empty one).<br />
To some readers, I regret to say that some non-standard knowledge might be required to read parts of this work. Mostly, I will sometimes use some vocabulary and concepts derived from mathematics, and maybe a little bit from physics. This will range from simply wording things in ways that are intuitive to the mathematician to actually using mathematical concepts and constructions. Overall, anyone without a mathematical background similar to that of a second year math student should be able to breeze through.</p>
<p>As for the others, rest assured that most of the work can still be read without knowledge of mathematics. This might however require the ability to think abstractly around areas of lacking knowledge and to spot when it is an appropriate time to do so. I regret to inform the reader that he might have to <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>Those who do not wish to undertake the effort might choose to confine themselves to a different kind of reading. Of course, that is far from the only acceptable reason to skip reading what I wrote here. No blame from me, I promise <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> .<br />
Lastly, I would like to acknowledge that much of what I wrote could be improved in clarity, precision, and understandability at the same time. This is my first time undertaking any kind of writing on that scope and I am not even focusing on the writing itself, but rather on the ideas I am researching. Hence, my general style and approach is experimental and clumsy. I hope to get better with time and that what I wrote is still reasonably pleasant to read.</p>
<h2 id="reading-help">Reading help</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each chapter, the reader may find a rectangular area with information regarding the prerequisites of the chapter and its reading difficulty. The prerequisites include the required previous chapters, but do not include chapters required indirectly (chapters that are only required by required chapters). They can also describe a need for outside information.<br />
Some chapters are meant to be read easily and quickly while others were written under the assumption that the reader would make frequent pauses to think. This assumption is called the "estimated need for active reading" (hurray for long names). It is graded on a scale going from one to five stars. A high grade can equally mean that I believe I said complex things or that I am dissatisfied with my own writing.</p>
<p>Of course, the reading help only relates to my estimation. Chapters with a large number of stars are chapters that feel confusing to me. But you probably don’t think like me (unless of course you are me). Once you see how wrong my estimations tend to be for your case, don’t hesitate to adjust accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-what-to-read">Choosing what to read</h2>
<p>Despite being presented as a string of chapters, this work is not necessarily meant to be read in a linear fashion, as books are usually read. Instead, many different entries can be read independently and I believe the best way to approach this document is to just see if anything sparks your curiosity. To that end, thematic lists of chapters are presented bellow. They are sadly not entirely independent and in some circumstances the reader might have to jump from list to list. That is, however, rare.<br />
Some entries might appear in more than one list. This is warranted when an entry cover a topic that strongly belong to both lists. I however have tried to avoid listing the same entry twice as much as possible.<br />
You can also find a table of content at the end of this document, if that is what you prefer.<br />
It is recommended to read either chapter <a href="#ChapST" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapST">[ChapST]</a> or <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a> first.</p>
