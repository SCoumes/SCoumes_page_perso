<h1 id="ChapJournal">Journal</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This is a special chapter containing a log, the entries of which have been written during the composition of the present document.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="section">2020-12-28</h2>
<p><span><strong>The relevance of the fundamental models I offer</strong></span><br />
At the time of writing this entry, I have written many of the fundamental chapter on the nature of truth and thought. This include chapters <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>, <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>, and <a href="#ChapTheseus" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTheseus">16</a>.<br />
One might be tempted to ask : what is the point of me thinking and writing about these ? My study does not take after the current academical state of the art, nor do I think it is better than it. I do not believe I am the world’s best thinker for these subjects or the best who studied them. I also spend little time on each topic, much less than serious scholars. So what is the point ? Why would I devote time to make a worse representation of something than the ones already available ?<br />
A first answer is that I do not aim to give the most "exact" or "precise" description of what I think and write about. My models are meant to serve as a basis for my other thoughts, applied and theoretical. Hence, they do not position themselves like the current state of the art. The goal is to refine, abstract, and perhaps correct my own intuition. I do not believe the effort worthless simply because better predictive models exist. Many human thought endeavors require to some extend to use models of those things I describe. I simply want mines to be better than what my own unsupervised intuition offer, with respect to certain criteria. These criteria include accuracy, but also other notions such as completeness of meaning and usability.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">2020-12-28</h2>
<p><span><strong>Wog cannot be constructivist</strong></span><br />
I approached this work with the intent to rebuild my own thoughts with some form of constructivist rigor. In a way there is success. I am building and describing things with much more constructivism than they previously showed. But I must accept that I will not get a complete constructivist description of my own thoughts in a year’s work. I don’t think I believed I would, but it does feel like I was secretly hoping for more.<br />
There are many concepts that are known to the human mind because they are present within it, with some non perfect degree of meaning. They cannot be build rigorously from first principles (at least I cannot). This is at least due to a lack of information on my part.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">2020-12-28</h2>
<p><span><strong>An excess of starting optimism</strong></span><br />
When I started my work on the wogian thoughts I drew a dependency graph to see in which order the different topics would have to be dealt with. This graph offered two sections "semantic" and "rigor" that were likely to be treated first. The idea being that I would start with the general notion of truth and meaning and then move on the "how to think well", which would then be used on the other topics. I don’t disagree with the general idea, but presenting that part as "the first two sections" seems simplistic and too optimist. Especially, it seems to be an excess of optimism regarding what could be done with constructivist rigor.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">2021-01-25</h2>
<p><span><strong>Morality determination</strong></span><br />
Perhaps, when my thoughts on the topic have matured, this entry will become a chapter. I am writing this a few days after chapters <a href="#MoralityTypes" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="MoralityTypes">[MoralityTypes]</a>, <a href="#MoralityUniversality" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="MoralityUniversality">[MoralityUniversality]</a>, <a href="#MoralityContext" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="MoralityContext">[MoralityContext]</a>, and <a href="#MoralityRelativity" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="MoralityRelativity">[MoralityRelativity]</a>. I have described morality as both a modelization of how we think and an idea construct used for that same thinking. It is, in my description, profoundly arbitrary from a semantical standpoint.<br />
It is intuitive to me that I should want my morality to be fixed, to have my local morality correspond to my global morality, at least on big issue. Why ? Why would that be a good thing ? Here are a few ideas on the topic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It feels desirable in itself in a way that probably comes from a cultural background pushing the idea of "objective morality", which tends to imply a fix morality (sometimes even a written one) to which one must adhere.</p></li>
<li><p>I am very conflicted on certain moral issues, and it is desriable to me to solve these conflicts because I want to act (or at least to take decisions) on these issues.</p></li>
<li><p>On the short term, moral dilemas are time wasting when they occure in situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Humans seem built to act "as if" they had a fixed morality, which I suspect to be used in our ability to feel outrage.</p></li>
<li><p>It fits with the view of self as an agent in game theory, which I would posit to be roughly our base view of self.</p></li>
<li><p>It is certainly profitable to society if people try to have stable moralities that can evolve to be compatible, rather than fickle situation-dependent ones.</p></li>
