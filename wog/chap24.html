<p>I have not read much by Immanuel Kant, and neither am I convinced that I should (I have been told he was a terrible writer). But the principle this chapter will discuss is, in my understanding, similar to some of the core tenets of his deontological morality. Anyway, I name the principle this chapter discusses the "universability principle" <a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a> .<br />
So what is this universability principle ? It is the principle that says that you should act in a certain way if it is desirable that everyone acts the same way (for whichever notion of "desirable" you are using, this is assumed to be fixed). As we will see bellow, this can (easily) be ambiguous and requires clarification. But before we move to the issue, I want to clarify that this is a deontological principle. You might argue that it is rational to act according to this principle from an utilitarian perspective. But that is a matter for decision theory and I will not discuss it further in this chapter. Instead, I will for now limit myself to the corresponding deontological principle.<br />
The issue is that the notion of "what would be good if everyone did it" can be quite vague, even once you have fixed your evaluation of how good it is for a given thing to be done by many people. Often when we wish to discuss the universability principle we use thought experiments with only two distinct possible actions. For example, we might consider the choice to be a liar or not and say "it is good if everyone decides not to be a liar". But in most situations in life there is a very large number of possible actions and many of them would be good if everyone chose them. Indeed, it can be the case that what matters is coordination more than the specificities of the common strategy chosen.<br />
I will use a thought experiment, but I will use one with more than a couple options. Indeed, mine has three. A large number of subjects taken at random in the population -let’s say 10 000 in France- are all faced simultaneously and independently with the same choice. Option A, B, or C. In all cases, their goal is to gain units of reward (RU). These can take the form of money or anything else you might find desirable instead.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If they choose option A they immediately gain 10 RU</p></li>
<li><p>If they choose option B they gain 9 RU, but if more than 50% of subjects choose B, everyone will gain an extra 20 RU.</p></li>
<li><p>If they choose option C they gain nothing, but if every subject chooses option C they all gain an extra <span class="math inline">10<sup>30</sup></span> RU.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that the universability principle is pushing us toward option B rather than A. But I am less sure about option C. Surely at least one of the others will fail to take it. <a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> So even though it is the best option when everyone takes it, I should probably avoid C.<br />
What is it within the principle that allows to skip C ? What extra quality does B has over C that is salient to the principle ? And while we are on the topic, what happens if the number of possibilities grows above the limits of our imagination ?<br />
Well obviously the difference between B and C is that B can succeed while C cannot (or rather has negligible odds of success). The simple answer is thus that the principle takes into account the odds of success of a given strategy.<br />
Similarly, we might look at different policies at different scales of universality. You might decide that it is good if everyone decides not to be a liar, but at the same time decide that it is also good if people instead decide that the should never lie, except to member of group X (because the members of group X can do terrible things). That is after all also a universal policy in the sense that you are thinking about what would happen if everyone chose it, but it feels less legitimate because of its special consideration for a specific case. Indeed, if you allow that sort of things, then you might recreate a form of utilitarism by always adding an exception for any situation you encounter for which violating the general principle will create overall good.<br />
In practice many strategies are mingled with one another and a given moves is almost always done for several reasons. When we take a decision, the same option can simultaneously entice us by a small probability of large gains and a larger probability of reasonable gains. I will speak no further on these matters <a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> but I can say something that is sure to surprise almost everyone : "it’s complicated". The universability principle accounts for the effects of a large number of people choosing a strategy, for the probability of getting a form of return on investment, and for the simplicity of the strategy. In a way, I would say the principle makes us take our decisions as if we were to campaign for our strategies, rather than just enact them.</p>
