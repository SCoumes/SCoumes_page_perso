</ul>
<p>Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline"> ⋆  ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I will introduce a description of the working of human minds and of the human paradigm regarding its own thoughts. That description was mostly obtained through introspection and thought experiments. Hence, it will be biased toward my personality and how I assume others to think. It is also of course perfectly imperfect.</p>
<p>What is a human in that context ? How narrow is my definition ? How similar to me do individuals have to be to be taken into account ? Not that much, but I do not ambition to produce a description that could fit every single possible states of mind for a human. A good first limit is insanity. I assume and accept that there are states of insanity that are not well represented by my descriptions.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the answer will depend on the section of the chapter you are in. The first section will describe a very generic model for the working of the human mind, that part should very broadly cover humans. Then, difference sections will use this model to describe how human think. This will include cultural specificities and I do not profess to be able to pinpoint them all accurately.<br />
Another point of interest is that this the model and following discussion presented here should be seen as a foundation layer for discussions on the human mind and the human perspective. And give a model and a description of the mind but said model contains vast parts that are not completely detailed. This leave room to discuss the human perspective and the working of the human mind withing the terms of the models. I give the knobs, it is left to the future to understand how they are set up.</p>
<h2 id="general-model">General model</h2>
<p>This section will describe the basic general model of the human mind upon which much of what follows will be based. I believe it will help if I now give an intuitive answer to the question "what is a mind, anyway ?". From an intuitive standpoint, we can say that the mind of a human is a mathematical abstraction of the process that governs the human’s behavior and decision taking abilities. The abstraction is considered at a scale compatible with the notion of "human entity" (no discussing atoms) and allowing to quickly represent the ideas a human has about how it works (the human).</p>
<p>This section takes a place in this document at a point at which I am still laying the contextual groundwork in which future reflection will (mostly) take place. In that regard, I am mostly offering arbitrary and imprecise models that are supposed to reflect a certain understanding of the fundamental topics at hand. This is fantastic and very enjoyable to do and -I am sure- to read, but might get a wee bit tedious if I do not help the reader understand, at least to some extent, why I make the choices I do. Hence, the model and my description of its parts will borrow vocabulary from the usual set of words used to speak about human mind. That is simply a way to help build intuition, and in now way a commitment to use these words in whatever fashion old fools and geniuses saw fit to define them.</p>
<p>I do not wish to enter the question of the definition of a specific mind and the difference between minds, a mind, and a mind-state (this is similar to the problem expressed in the story of the boat of Theseus). That is a different topic for another time. For now, I will simply describe a mathematical model for a specific kind of system and say that the mind of a human can be described through this model as one such system. The model of minds is the general descriptions which can accept instances. A mind is one such instance, and that concept isn’t perfectly clear. A mind-state is the state of a mind at a specific point in time.<br />
The model considers the human mind as an interconnected system evolving through time. Time is considered to be isomorphic to <span class="math inline">ℝ</span>, in the obvious way. We consider a mind to be comprised of several parts with inputs and outputs. At any time, the parts have a state which can evolve both by itself and under the influence of the inputs. Parts have no memory. Their variation is entirely defined by their current state and their inputs. The output is, in turn, a direct function of the state of the part. I have chosen not to give a precise mathematical description of that process. As will soon become apparent, the states and the inputs/output need to be rather complex objects, and I do not intend to tackle the work of representing the corresponding sets of possibilities right now. Besides, insofar as I lack a perfect definition of the human mind, such an effort would probably amount to very little gain in understanding. Just think of something similar to how mechanical systems are often described used partial time derivative equations.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#ChapHumanMindFigGMP" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMindFigGMP">9.1</a> gives a summary of the various parts used to represent the human mind and their connections. The "change" part can have an effect on many other parts which is no represented in the figure (see parts description bellow). Save for that exception, every effect is represented on the figure by an arrow. Hence, a part is determined by everything that is connected to it by an arrow (again, save for the "change" effect). On this figure, boxes represent a normal part. Circles are a representation of external inputs, and diamonds are parts that have no inertia (the state is a direct function of the inputs).</p>
<p>I will now devote most of the rest of this section to a part by part description of the diagram from figure <a href="#ChapHumanMindFigGMP" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMindFigGMP">9.1</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Senses</strong> represent all normal inputs for the mind. Mostly this simply mean what we perceive through our senses, even though I do not exclude the possibility for another kind of input to fall into that category.<br />
<strong>The interference</strong> is a representation of the ability for changes in the physical world to influence how we think outside of the effects of senses. The best example is certainly that of alcohol, but I also include the effect of sports and similar processes.<br />
<strong>The surface</strong> represents what we "feel" as our thoughts, emotions, and everything else. The description of the train of thoughts of a specific human amounts to the string of states through which the surface of his mind goes. One could say that the surface is a representation of our awareness. The surface can be said to "contain" or to "realize" various "perceptions". I identify two main classes of perceptions : thoughts and feelings. The surface is entirely determined by the synthesis.<br />
<strong>The output</strong> represents what our mind "concludes to". This includes the decision to move in certain ways (indeed, the decision to move the various muscles required to breath is a part of the output). However, I include a second part, "the intent". While the rest of the output is determined by the synthesis, the intent is directly determined by the surface. It is an expression of our resolve and of the decisions we take, especially concerning ourselves. The intent influences the synthesis. That process is largely what we call "the application of our will".<br />
<strong>The memory</strong> is, to everyone’s surprise, a representation of the human memory. It contains different kinds of "memory units" and I do not profess to have an exhaustive list. Let’s list what I did include.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General memory : long term non specific memory</p></li>
<li><p>Associations : a part of memory dedicated to linking memories and ideas with one another, and to giving ratings on relevant scales to some specific concepts. Example : we store how likely we consider some statements to be true, and how much we like certain things.</p></li>
<li><p>Active memory : short term low capacity memory. The whole system is set up so that whenever something is loaded into this memory unit, a corresponding thought forms on the surface. In other words, we are aware of what goes into this memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Process specific memory : a catchall term for all memory that is dedicated for use only by a handful of subprocesses (see the relevant entry on subprocesses).</p></li>
<li><p>Self description : stored information on the way we are. Directly influences the synthesis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The only think that can update the memory is a subprocesses (yet again, save for the change effect).<br />
<strong>The subprocesses</strong> are where most of the actual work occurs. The idea behind them is that the human mind makes use of many processes to handle specific intellectual tasks. Processes exhibit a lot of variety, ranging from those which handle unconscious breathing to those we use for complex logical reasoning. Subprocesses have different inputs. They can have access to the memory and are influenced by the mind’s inputs and by the current state of the surface. Of course, not all subprocesses need to use all those inputs.<br />
<strong>The synthesis</strong> is simply the process that takes the set of the effects of all subprocesses and determines what we end up thinking and what we output. It is mostly a summary of the subprocesses, but the way that summary is made is influenced by several parts. This decides which subprocesses "win" when they are opposed, which are deemed important and which are ignored, and so on. The synthesis is impacted by what we are, by our current intent, and by external interferences. It also determines the change.<br />
<strong>The change</strong> is the representation of the way the mind can change. If we think that every part is a function that is influenced by the inputs and the state of the part, then the state of the change can be seen as an implicit secondary argument used everywhere and which correspond to the ability of the parts to evolve. Changes are divided into two main kinds : temporary and lasting. As a rule of thumb, lasting changes tend to be the result of repeated synthesis effects (we might develop a new subprocesse to handle a specific frequent situation) whereas temporary changes are mostly an effect of immediate outside interference (i.e. booze). However, this rule accepts some exceptions. For example, sudden brain damage.<br />
Most of the work for this section is done. This paragraph provides a few additions, one per indentation, which should prove to be lighter reading than what came before. At least, I hope so. What I wrote above does not exactly fit my own definition of "well worded and enjoyable to read".</p>
<p>Now that all the parts of the model I intend to use have been described, it is my hope that a reasonable dose of reasoning will lead the reader to an understanding of said model.</p>
<p>The language abuse in which we speak of someone’s mind to speak of the instance of the model representing that person’s mind is to be tolerated and even encouraged.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to point out that the model makes no mention of the practical physical parts of the brain that are supposed to implement the features represented. Nothing says that every part of the brain belongs to at most one part of the model and, even if that were the case, nothing says brain portions that belong to the same model part have to be physically next to eachothers.</p>
<h2 id="processing-and-functioning">Processing and functioning</h2>
<h3 id="thoughts-ideas-and-kirkins">Thoughts, ideas, and kirkins</h3>
<p>The time has come to go through a few points of vocabulary and to connect what I described as a modelization of the human mind with was I presented earlier as a definition of truth and meaning (see chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>). As the title of this subsection might have lead the most astute of readers to guess, I will talk about thoughts, ideas, and kirkins.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with thoughts. They are the basic elements that can be present in the "thoughts" part of the surface and of course, they give it its name. The notion of thoughts I intend to use isn’t very different to what most people who delve on the subject would offer (as of the time of writing). Raw feelings do not count as thoughts, but most other things that can be "in" the surface are. Notably, anything we might envision was said by our "inner voice" counts as a thought. When a thought is present in the surface, we say it "occurs".</p>
<p>A mind is said to be "thinking" when thoughts are the main elements present in the surface. This is mainly opposed to situations where the surface is mostly occupied by feelings.</p>
<p>Ideas are closely linked with thoughts. They are an abstraction for a part of the way the mind works and are to be considered as "objects". They can correspond to a string (or sometimes simply set) of thoughts, be stored in memory, or be implicitly used by some subprocesses. Ideas can correspond to a single thought, but some ideas are never expressed with a single thought. There is no inherent limitation on the complexity of an idea, given an arbitrarily large number of thoughts. As an abuse of language, it is perfectly fine to consider that some ideas "are" thoughts, insofar as they always correspond to the same thought.</p>
<p>Ideas correspond to kirkins. Not all kirkins correspond to an idea but all ideas correspond to a kirkin. That correspondence isn’t capable of reaching kirkinplexes. What might come closest is "the idea of a model". We discuss that point in subsection <a href="#ChapHumanMindSubModels" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMindSubModels">9.3.2</a>. For the purpose of what follows, I even assume that all ideas perfectly correspond to a single kirkin. In that respect, I tolerate yet one more abuse of language, confusing ideas with the related kirkins. Notably, we may speak of binding context for ideas, still drawing on the same correspondence.</p>
<h3 id="ChapHumanMindSubModels">Models</h3>
<p>Many human ideas take place in a "model of something". When you discuss a car and you say "the engine", you are already referring to a set of connected assumptions about how cars are made. That is what I call a model as used by a human mind. It bears noticing that a model isn’t necessarily a model of <em>something</em>. A good example would be mathematical theories, which give meaning to some statements and ideas, but are not a model of anything inside reality. It is reasonable to consider that models correspond to kirkinplexes. However, models are not ideas, whereas kirkinplexes are themselves kirkins. It is still perfectly possible to reify models as ideas through "the idea of", as can be done for kirkinplexes. I see no need to develop further on what models are for now, the intuition is very similar to that behind kirkinplexes.<br />
Models can be created by the mind, they can be stored in memory, and they can be updated (and often are when they are used). When the mind handles ideas that require a model, subprocesses can create and use parts of the corresponding model. The important notion here is "parts of" : there is often no need to recall the entirety of the model. In fact, even when updating the model, there is no need to consider it in its entirety, and various parts of the model can be forgotten at different rates. Indeed, there is often no need for a whole model to exist when we act as if it did, and sometimes it does not. A part of that effect is that we often handle our ideas in light of a bundle of model parts that do not really work together, frequently because they use varying degrees of precision.<br />
Last addition to this subsection, I will say that when creating or updating a model, we often copy the structure of pre-existing models.</p>
<h3 id="the-base-model-and-the-base-process">The base model and the base process</h3>
<p>We, humans, have a base model of reality and broad lines for the way we function. The model itself includes many assumptions about the way things are, which are difficult to pinpoint and challenge (though not impossible). A good example would be our base perception of time. However, beyond the base model we find the base process. It is constructed through the general structure of the mind, and through the way base ideas and subprocesses are set up. Mostly, I am getting at the fact that a large part of our way to act and think seems natural to us.<br />
One part of this process upon which I would like to elaborate a little bit is our use of probabilities and estimations. Overall, I would say that bayesian probabilities are a good representation of the model we wish we used for our estimations of likelihood. I consider our use of such estimations to be based on bits and pieces of models locally arranged to satisfy the description given by probability theory. However, even locally, the system struggles with very low or high probability.</p>
<p>I will also add that we probably (<em>eh, funny</em>) maintain several probability models at the same time, interconnected with each others. To illustrate this last point, one can think of the fear of the dark in situations in which one is certain that there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Of course, our estimations are mostly stored in the "association" part of the memory.</p>
<h2 id="tunality-and-cogitation">Tunality and cogitation</h2>
<p>To wrap this up, this section will introduce a few words and notion to describe how humans think when they try to produce and extract meaning and truth. I am saddened to say that this will mostly mean more arbitrary definitions to be used at a later time. Very annoying, I am sure.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="tunality">Tunality</h3>
<p>Let’s start with tunality. "Tunal" is a catchall adjective for thought processes that require a degree of awareness of the working of the subprocesses involved in the process. One could say that tunality is the quality of the mind that is aware of its own thinking. Awareness of a thing is the presence of a corresponding idea in one’s surface part of the mind. Ideas can be more or less complete and provide imperfect descriptions of things. As such, tunality is not a perfectly binary quality. One can be more or less tunal.</p>
<p>The awareness doesn’t have to be perfectly concomitant with the thinking. For example, someone who simply does calculations by pure trained instinct is, by default, not acting tunaly. However, if that same person purposely trained that same instinct and thought before doing the calculations "I will now use my trained instinct which often works well", then the whole process can be considered more tunal.<br />
Now seems like a good time to mention the "Dual Process Theory", which I found described on the LessWrong forum <span class="citation" data-cites="T1T2"></span>. Said theory posits the existence of two types of processes within the human mind : type 1 and type 2. The following sentence is taken from the description found on the LessWrong wiki. "Type 2 (also known as System 2) processes are those which require working memory, and Type 1 (also known as System 1) are those which not." What they call working memory is roughly what I called active memory. It would be false to say that type 2 systems are those used in a tunal reflection, but I still believe that the ideas can be linked. However, pure uncontrolled instinct based on the current state of mind would, in my understanding, still count as type 2. It is not in my eyes tunal. <span> Still not sure I perfectly understand their idea.</span><br />
As mentioned before, one can be more or less tunal during a certain process.</p>
<h3 id="cogitation">Cogitation</h3>
<p>We also introduce cogitation, which should strike no reader as a new concept, even though the word itself is nonstandard. Cogitation is simply the action undertaken by a mind which is thinking on purpose with the stated goal of extracting truth or producing ideas. Because cogitation happens "on purpose", it seems that it should incur at least a modicum of tunality. During cogitation, the mind is say to "cogitate".</p>
<h3 id="idea-bishing">Idea bishing</h3>
<p>When we think, the process of chaining thoughts one after another is called a thought process.</p>
<p>We now introduce the concept of idea bishing. An idea bishing only considers a chain of ideas and the way they are linked by rules (which one my intuitively consider as operations). Because that linking process can sometime aim to abstract in detail operations that do not strictly rely on ideas <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> , we allow the use of "token" alongside ideas. Tokens are simply objects of the bishing that are not ideas but can be used for structural reasons. The goal of the concept of bishing is to abstract all considerations regarding the detailed working of the mind to keep only the structure of the chain of thoughts</p>
<p>In that regard, some thought process can be said to have a corresponding idea bishing. That is not the case of all thought processes, as the idea of "idea bishing" is intended to represent structured thought and therefore requires a degree of tunality. A non tunal and pseudo-random chain of thoughts would not count as having a corresponding idea bishing, even thought from a mathematical standpoint we might still suggest one.<br />
As a quick note, the idea pendant to a kirkinplex is called an ideoplex, and I will say nothing more of this for now.</p>
