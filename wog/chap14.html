<h1 id="ChapRigorGene">General study of the concept of rigor</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter benefits from having read chapter <a href="#ChapRigorCogi" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorCogi">14</a>, even thought that is not a requirement.<br />

<h2 id="rigor">Rigor</h2>
<p>As I have said before in chapter <a href="#ChapRigorCogi" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorCogi">14</a>, I consider the central idea behind the notion of rigor to be "the act of structuring a process in accordance to rules". Often, we speak of rigor in the context of processes for which the rules are a given implicit. When such is the case, the notion of rigor corresponds to one’s following of those rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we speak of rigor as of a binary quality. Either the process is rigorous, or it is not. But in my experience, that vocabulary hides a gradual notion of rigor, allowing for processes and individual to be more or less rigorous. Was is "not rigorous" is then often actually "not rigorous enough". There can however be exceptions, such as when we consider the notion of "perfect rigor", forms of rigor that accept only a very strict set of rules.</p>
<p>When I speak of rules, I do not simply mean the rules of an idea bishing process. Instead, the "rules" as speak of here are rules in a broad sense -sometimes even simply principles- that dictate how the process on which the rigor is applied is to go. To reformulate, I suppose I could say that the rules of rigor are instruction regarding how a certain thing is to be done.</p>
<p>Rigor has been an important notion for me for the past few years at the very least. In that time, there is a fact I noticed early on : different people in different contexts use the word rigor with very different ideas of what we are supposed to do to be rigorous. I have heard the very same processes be called rigorous and non-rigorous in front of me; by people in do not consider the be idiots <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> . I have decided to produce a list of some of the forms of rigor I have encountered, giving each a name and a short description. This list will occupy most of the rest of this chapter (section <a href="#ChapRigorGeneSecList" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorGeneSecList">15.2</a>).<br />
I would like to point out that often people will call behavior that do not fall within their idea of how things are supposed to be done "non rigorous". Well, often in some circles I suppose.</p>
<p>Sometimes this should be considered as a form of rigor (they way they think things should be done constitutes a set of rules), and sometimes that is just something people say because they dislike what they see. The distinction isn’t perfectly clear between these two cases, but I would still like to offer a bit more on the topic. A relevant criteria seems to me to be that of understanding and motivation. If these people have an idea of what is happening at the time and have a companion idea of why we should be more rigorous, then I tend to be more enclined to speak of a "form of rigor" and less of a "bunch of angry words".</p>
<p>It occurs to me that the paragraph above assumes that rigor is seen as a good thing. I will say it now, rigor is the kind of words used by those who consider it a good thing, at least to some extend and degree.</p>
<h2 id="ChapRigorGeneSecList">Enumeration of various forms of rigor</h2>
<h3 id="calculatory-rigor">Calculatory Rigor</h3>
<p>This form of rigor is that of the human computer. Showing signs of caluclatory rigor means making calculation <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> while making sure not to make mistakes and that every step can be trivially deduced from the rules allowed by the calculation.</p>
<h3 id="demonstrative-rigor">Demonstrative Rigor</h3>
<p>This is the main form of rigor of the mathematician. It is the rigor you are supposed to deploy when making demonstrations, ensuring that every step of the deduction process is allowed in the deductive context you use. Contrary to calculatory rigor, this form of rigor consider processes that handle ideas and not symbols. The rules used do not have to be as clear and precise as the ones of calculus.</p>
<h3 id="constructivist-rigor">Constructivist Rigor</h3>
<p>This is the rigor we exhibit when we build ideas from other ideas, ensuring to use proper definition processes at each step and trying to understand what our "base ideas" are.</p>
<h3 id="assiduous-rigor">Assiduous Rigor</h3>
<p>I use this term for the general idea of "taking great care to do things precisely as instructed and with care". You exhibit this kind of rigor when obeying a protocol in the detail with little to no initiative. But also when you force yourself to stay focused on a task with precise hand movements, such as small scale painting.</p>
<h3 id="life-organizational-rigor">Life organizational Rigor</h3>
<p>This is simply the rigor of someone who handles certain aspects of his life with care and in a very structured way. For example, making sure to eat every day at the same time with a lot of precision.</p>
<h3 id="rationalist-rigor">Rationalist Rigor</h3>
<p>This is the rigor of the one who exhibits rationality. <span> More on that later.</span></p>
<h3 id="wogian-rigor">Wogian Rigor</h3>
<p>I have written a chapter on this topic, see chapter <a href="#ChapRigorCogi" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorCogi">14</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tunal-rigor">Tunal Rigor</h3>
<p>I must confess that this kind of rigor comes as an afterthought. It is the rigor you deploy when you use tunal subprocesses to think. You might say that this kind of rigor corresponds to those who keep control of their own mind, insofar as they keep it dependent on their awareness.</p>
<h3 id="meaning-rigor">Meaning rigor</h3>
<p>This is the rigor we exhibit when we make sure that our ideas are sufficiently meaningful. The more meaningful our ideas are, the more we exhibit this kind of rigor. If they are meaningful enough then we can declare ourselves "rigorous" with respect to this kind of rigor.</p>
<p>This kind of rigor is a large part of wogian rigor.</p>
<h3 id="definition-rigor">Definition rigor</h3>
<p>This is the rigor we exhibit when we make sure our ideas are sufficiently well defined. This is not constructivist rigor because not all definitions are constructivist. This is not meaning rigor because one can have meaningful ideas without using definitions.</p>
