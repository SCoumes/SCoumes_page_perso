<h1 id="ChapJustHumanThinking">Human thought is just humans thinking</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has two very minor requirements which can be skipped without hesitation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The knowledge that chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a> is about the modelization of the human mind. You now have that knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>The notion of <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction from chapter <a href="#ChapMindIdeas" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapMindIdeas">11</a>. But it’s just for a footnote.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline"> ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<p>I have for a long time operated under some insufficiently abstract <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> intuition regarding the functionment of the human mind. We all need to have at least some model of what minds are and how people think, at least to be able to communicate and think about our own thoughts. This intuition was mine, and I think it’s incompleteness was a flaw in my thinking. I now believe I have identified the broad lines of this intuition, which has been -at least in abstraction- with the model of the mind from chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>.<br />
I think my understanding of the human mind was based on a dichotomy between an first part one may call "reason", corresponding to an idealized view of a "rational mind", and a disruptive part which we might call "the subconscious" containing what is harder to understand from an user perspective. The idea was that we were mostly the reason part of the brain of which the normal state is to think perfectly (or at least very well) and that we were continuously being interrupted and influenced by the passions, which are important to our identity but not good for thinking.<br />
This insufficiently understood <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> model was a source of confusion for me. Because it seemed to me that we were naturally rational <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> , I could understand being temporarily disrupted by an emotion but I could not understand how a given human could be incapable of rationality even when calm. This had the potential to make me reject people that behaved irrationally even when calm. I could not understand how they existed, it was mind boggling. Of course, this stance also made it more difficult to discover lacks of rationality on my part when I was calm. It however did not prevent me from understanding my own weakness to emotional bias.<br />
I would say that the tendency to reject people whose behavior conflicted with my intuition came from a more general flaw : emotional distress at seeing a model put in question by reality. Because the individual was a source of distress, it was seen as an offender against me, which can in turn generate hostility. Of course, obvious lacks of rationality have a tendency to be displeasant for other reasons. But the behavior seems clearly bad in general. When a part of reality contradicts our predictions we should correct our predictions, not hate the part of reality.<br />
I believe I now know what to say to past me to solve that problem for him. A human is a system that has the ability to produce thoughts and ideas, which are integrals to its functionment. Until more has been said, no string of thoughts can be seen as a contradiction of the "nature of the human minds". In general, such systems should be able to think stupid thoughts without issues. Just like I can write "1+1=2. 1+1=3." in a text document on my computer without violating the "fundamental nature of computers". In pursuit of a better understanding of human minds, we say others things about them. These are estimations or sometimes predictions. When our model contradicts reality, we probably said something wrong. <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> If that is the case we should correct the model or accept that we are using imperfect models that do not work in all cases.<br />
As a quick defense of past me, I would like to point out that his position wasn’t all that shameful. The "reason"/"passions" dichotomy is quite common and the issue within his thoughts was mostly allowed by a lack of complete abstract study of his ideas, which takes time. Also, he was aware of flaws and of a need to inquire more deeply, which he resolved he would one day take time to do. That day finally came, and it is in the context of that process that I am currently working. Also, I like to think that I distanced myself from my base model/intuition as it showed itself to be faulty. Admittedly, the part about "irrational people" behaving in a manner "opposed to human nature" should have been easy to identify as problematic and should have been eliminated much sooner.</p>
