<h1 id="ChapTruth">Truth : overview and introduction</h1>
<p><span id="ChapTruthEntry" label="ChapTruthEntry">[ChapTruthEntry]</span></p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has no requirements.<br />
Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline"> ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this ?</h2>
<p>This is the first chapter in a series of chapter that attempt to describe my model (my way to view) the notions of truth and meaning. In other words, this is a presentation of a view on the very notion of meaning. The next section gives an introduction and an overview on the topic. If you don’t want to have to deal with a lot of pseudo-mathematical definitions then reading it should be enough to give you a general sense of the theory. But if you do want to delve deeper, section <a href="#TruthOverviewSecNext" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="TruthOverviewSecNext">2.3</a> will give you the additional information you need before you approach the following chapters in the series.<br />
Because this chapter contains the aforementioned summary and because it helps simplifying references in the rest of this document, this chapter will often be cited as a reference as a way to point to the entire series of chapters.</p>
<p><span> The series of chapters as a whole is currently still under construction. </span></p>
<h2 id="kirkin-theory-an-overview">Kirkin theory : an overview</h2>
<h3 id="kirkins">Kirkins</h3>
<p>I avoid using the word "idea" or "concept" for the most fundamental bearers of meaning and rather offer my own word, "kirkin". As will become apparent later in this document, I use the word "idea" to speak of the correspondents to kirkins within humans minds. So you might think of kirkins as human independent, purer ideas. Also, all concepts are kirkins but not all kirkins are concept.<br />
Kirkins give their name to the entire construction I present in this series of chapter, "kirkin theory".<br />
Some kirkins can have meaning, but not all. Those that do are called "evaluable". Some kirkins are statements, those are the kirkins that are affirmations, the only ones that can be true.<br />
Kirkins that are evaluable can be more or less meaningful. This is a central idea. There are degrees of meaningfulness and they can not all be compared.</p>
<div class="ex">
<p><strong>Example 2.1</strong>.  <em>One can think of the famous question "how many stones do you need before you have a heap of stones ?", which shows that the notion of "heap" is not perfectly defined. That is an example of a lack of meaning.<br />
Another form of lack of meaning can be shown with the concept of "duty". Often, some who speak of it have no clear idea of what it is. It is not, like with the "heap", that they do not know the exact limits, but rather that they have no clear idea of what kind of object "duty" is supposed to be.<br />
Of course, not all meaninglessness can be compared. It seems absurd to discuss whether the notion of heap is better defined than that of duty.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Likewise, statements also admit degrees of truth.<br />
The theory also introduce two "basis" respectively called "the basis of dirt" and "the basis of truth". The former represents "reality" or "the material universe", whatever that means. The later represents the fundamental nature of truth.</p>
<h3 id="kirkinplexes">Kirkinplexes</h3>
<p>A kirkinplex, which is a kind of kirkin, is roughly equivalent to the notion of model. It provides context for other kirkins to be meaningful.</p>
<div id="ChapSTexAddi" class="ex">
<p><strong>Example 2.2</strong>.  <em>For the statement "1+1=2" to be meaningful, you can either see it as a perfectly defined kirkin in itself, or you can see it as using the previously defined notions of "number" and "addition". In the second case, the pre-defined mathematical theories you use are a kirkinplex.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The point of kirkinplexes is to give a representation to the structure present in situations such as the one shown in example <a href="#ChapSTexAddi" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapSTexAddi">Example 2.2</a>.<br />
When we use a kirkinplex to give meaning to a kirkin, we say that we "bind" the kirkin to the kirkinplex.</p>
<h3 id="kirkin-bishing">Kirkin Bishing</h3>
<p>Kirkin Bishing is a representation of some kinds of thought processes. Mostly, it is a representation of inferences and definition.</p>
<p>The core idea is that a bishing is a string of steps. Each step has some input kirkins (its "entries") and a single output kirkin (its "product"). Each step must also use a rule, which comes from a given set of rules, and uses in its input only kirkins that were "allowed" at the beginning (they are hypothesis) or that were the output of a previous step.</p>
<p>In other words, we take a basic set of kirkins, some rules, and we use the rules to produce more kirkins. This represents some kinds of inference or definition processes.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-bullet-points">A few bullet points</h3>
<p>Overall, the model follows the following ideas :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The kirkins are very divers and represent a lot of different kinds of concepts/ideas. They can be combined in different fashions.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain kirkins are evaluated to give a degree of truth/meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>kirkinplexes are a representation of contexts that give meaning to kirkins.</p></li>
<li><p>The main way to get an evaluable kirkin is to take a normal kirkin and bind it to a kirkinplex.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Point 1 is a given considering that I want to offer some degree of structure. Point 2 is the solution found to the need to express partial truth and meaning, which is important to a large portion of human thoughts. Point 3 and 4 corresponds to the idea that we often create "semantic contexts" for our ideas, outside of which they would lose all meaning. Point 3 in particular underlines the notion of models.</p>
<h2 id="TruthOverviewSecNext">Reading what comes after</h2>
<p>Reading above this point is enough to get "the gist" of my kirkin theory. If you read further, I assume it means you want to go deeper and encounter some pseudo-mathematical definitions. This means I will also assume a degree of ease with basic mathematical notions. But I will not use anything too complex or exotic and I believe that if you are used to mathematics you will be able to handle any lacking knowledge quickly through a quick look at online resources.<br />
So what is the ratio between the "pseudo" and the "mathematical" ? Well the goal is not to produce a completely satisfying model. I will use notations that correspond to the usual ZFC set theory but all of this is still always intuition based. I am not describing a ZFC object describing my theory of truth. Hence, I am not trying to adhere to the limitations and guarantees of ZFC. In particular, my use of set theoristic notions does not presupposes the axiom of foundation.<br />
Because of the limitations inherent to the topic of meaning itself, most of the "definitions" do not show proper constructivist rigor and are actually far from proper definitions. I describe a model by giving characteristics for elements and general ideas on how these elements are supposed to interact within the model.<br />
The chapters in this series are meant to be read linearly. The titles are supposed to be helpful if you want to peruse and choose what you like, but you should consider yourself warned. You skip chapters in this series at your own risks. There are deadly dangers. Like crocodiles and booby traps.</p>
