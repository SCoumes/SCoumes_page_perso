<h1 id="ChapIntWis">INT vs WIS</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has no requirements.<br />
Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline">⋆</span></p>
</div>
<p>This short chapter is dedicated to the difference between intelligence and wisdom. The goal is more to speak of wisdom than intelligence though. Both are vague words to which many people have given many different meanings. Wisdom in particular has many different definitions that are different beyond usual differences in formulation and notion framing. Also, these words (intelligence and wisdom) are often used with very little thought as to their meaning.</p>
<p>I however do not believe that they are only ever used in pointless ways. I have thought about the notions and I think I reached ideas that deserve to be thought of. These are the ideas I speak about here under the names wisdom and intelligence. Also, there are ideas I believe the words are at least sometimes used to refer to.</p>
<p>I am not about to give proper definitions. What follows is a clarification of my use of notions but is not at all constructivist. In case of ambiguity, I advise to call them "wogian wisdom" and "wogian intelligence".</p>
<p>Last clarifications. I am speaking of wisdom as "the characteristic of the wise" and not "knowledge". I am speaking of wisdom as a characteristic of the human mind that we can posses to different degree <a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> . In particular, this is not a discussion on the nature of cognition. Last of the lasts, I must point out that I will in this chapter speak of "thinking well" without clarification. I am allowing myself to do so in the same fashion I could tell you that my mother knows how to pick good watermelons when shopping. I don’t need to that you what I my tastes on watermelons are for you to understand the core of the idea. Clarification of the notion of "good thinking" is left for some other time.<br />
So, let’s start with wisdom. The core idea of the notion of wisdom I am interested about <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> is the ability of a mind to choose how to think well. It is about choosing the right thought patterns when considering a situation.</p>
<p>Heuristics and knowledge can sometimes be called wisdom even while referring to this notion. In the case of heuristics, I would say we sometimes consider a heuristic to be in itself the right way to think about something. In that regard, "don’t think about it and just leave the tiger alone" might be seen as wisdom by those who think it’s the right attitude. As for knowledge, I would say it can be a generalization on the idea that those who have an idea tend to be wise. The idea isn’t the wisdom, but it can be correlated with or instrumental to the wisdom. Hence a small language abuse.</p>
<p>However, wisdom is about approaching thought. Choosing what to think. Thus general knowledge and heuristics are more appropriate to be considered wisdom. We can call something "specialized wisdom", but that feels different than the pure idea of "wisdom".<br />
Moving on to intelligence, what can we say ? Intelligence is the ability to think well. It is what we use once we start thinking at least a little abstractly.<br />
There is a middle ground, a way for intelligence and wisdom to blur. We can use intelligence to gain wisdom and we can sometimes use intelligence to replace it. Indeed, what if I start thinking and then at some point deduce that I should use different thought patterns and do so consciously ? Then my action is a product of cognition but also within the realm of what I described as wisdom. I would say that when such questions arise the time has generally come to use more precise notions than wisdom. I would also however call this "intelligence that is wisdom" if needed.</p>

<li id="fn70" role="doc-endnote"><p>Wisdom has many different definitions pointing at very different notions. I am picking one but then vagueness still remains and so I aim for the "core idea". Homonymy does not preclude vagueness.<a href="#fnref70" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
