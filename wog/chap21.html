<h1 id="ChapMoralityContext">Morality : A first look</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has the following requirements :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a> (soft requirement)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated need for active reading: <span class="math inline"> ⋆  ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="foreword-5">Foreword</h2>
<p>This is the first chapter on morality. The idea here is to speak a little bit about why morality exists and how people think about it normally. Just a quick overview.<br />
With that part out of the way, I will clarify to some small extent what morality is (what kind of thing it is). This will then prove useful for future chapters on morality.</p>
<h2 id="morality-where-does-it-starts">Morality, where does it starts ?</h2>
<p>The point of this section is not to discuss reasons for the existence of morality from a game theories standpoint. Neither is it to speak of how morality first came to be historically.<br />
Instead, I will start with this: humans can experience a host of difference feelings associated with morality. We can feel certain things to be "right" and others to be "wrong". Most importantly, these notions intuitively make sense to us. We also feel drawn to act according to what these feelings describe as "right".<br />
So what what kind of picture do the common considerations on the notion of morality paint ? An ugly and messy one.</p>
<p>Various humans have various considerations regarding notions of "morality", "ethic", or other variations. Even thought these can have very different status, they mostly correspond to the aforementioned feelings and evolve with them. So it mostly seems to be a lot of rationalization.</p>
<p>The situation can be made more complex when people reach a single notion of morality then update their feelings without changing their understanding of the word "morality" or "good". We can then reach statements such as "it’s good to be bad", which prove frustrating to parse.<br />
Still, almost everyone <a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> uses a notion of good and bad and creates an idea construct that describes certain things as "good" and others as "bad". These constructs are mostly what people are referring to when they speak of their morality.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-context">Getting a context</h2>
<p>Let’s keep this simple. A part of the behavior of a large number of subsystems within the human mind generally gives rise to a valuation of certain ideas on a specific scale. This correspond to what we speak of when we say something is considered "morally good" or "morally bad". That same process can influence our decision processes in some circumstances.<br />
That process as a whole is what I call morality. I do not posit that morality corresponds to a specific part of the mind with regard to the model of chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a> but rather I use the notion as an abstraction modeling some of what happens within a mind. It is not a perfect model of what happens within a human mind and I posit that such a model wouldn’t give much room to the notion of human individual as we usually use it. <a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> I however estimate that the notion of how morality works described here is mostly correct for most humans in my society.<br />
As noted in the previous section, humans often have models of their own morality, which in turn are used as a part of it (they participate in the working of the morality). Quite often these models are bogus, have meaningfulness issues, and are in my eyes too low quality to be used as is. In such cases it is easy enough to say that the model is a piece of morality but also a mistake. However, humans can also have idea constructs as a part of their morality that are not directly trying to model anything. These also are not necessarily low quality. Hence and with generality, I must simply speak of an idea construct that is a part of morality and can describe both what morality is and how it influences the decision process. See diagram bellow (figure <a href="#MoralityContextFigDiag" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="MoralityContextFigDiag">22.1</a>).</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="alpha-and-beta"><span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span></h2>
<p>Because it felt appropriate to me I split the notion of morality in two.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> morality is the interface between <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> morality and the rest of the decision processes. By abuse of language we might say it is strong or weak, referring to the importance in our decision process that <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> morality allows <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> morality to have.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> morality is the process within our minds that describes some ideas as a "good" or "bad". Of course, we usually speak of judging a thing rather than the idea of the thing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to speak of "wogian morality" to refer to these notion if you need to avoid ambiguity.<br />
Sometimes, we let our morality change with time or according to the circumstances. Notably, we might allow our temporary circumstances to temporarily change our opinion on a specific point because it is convenient to us. I speak of "global morality" to refer to the abstract idea of our morality "in general". We might say that something is good according to my normal morality if I almost always say that it is good. I speak of "local morality" to refer to the specific state of one’s morality at a given moment.</p>
<p>These notions are intentionally vague and should only be used when the time scales of "global" and "local" are unambiguous.</p>
