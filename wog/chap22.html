</div>
<p>Let’s take a step back and ask the question again but with a different perspective : what is morality ? A person’s notion of their own morality is an ideoplexe (or simply an idea) that partially serves as an abstraction of their own way to think. If we want to abstract the specific human X away, then a specific morality is simply a kirkinplex, which corresponds to the idea in X’s mind that itself corresponds to X’s modelization of himself. A subtlety is that the idea is at the same time a modelization and an active tool used for thinking.<br />
But we will simply keep in mind that a morality (a given one) is a kirkinplex. Is it a modelization of reality (the basis) or of a part of it ? No. Cool.</p>
<p>Is it a part of or a modelization of math, or of the model of truth ? No and no. Cool again. Glad that’s settled. In that sense (and in that sense only for now), I will say that morality is arbitrary.<br />
But have I not then implied that morality is a lie, absurd, meaningless, ... ? Meh. I have in no way implied that morality is meaningless in the sense of that word in the wogian theory of meaning. For whatever other brand of "meaningless" you are using, please consult with a relevant expert.</p>
<p>But we can take that list of accusations as a whole and answer "sort of but it doesn’t matter". I do believe that plenty of theories of morality have been lies, absurd, or meaningless in the past. If you belong to one of the corresponding schools of thought, than it might also be what I am saying about what you think. I don’t know, we would have to talk about your case.<br />
But I am not saying that it is bad or a form of irrationality to use morality, consider it important, or let it influence our lives. That it is arbitrary isn’t an issue. But we still should be aware of that fact.<br />
But now if we think a little more we see another issue approaching. Can you guess what it is? you have this sentence to find out! What about all the times we argue about morality? It seems that we shouldn’t argue about something arbitrary. At best, we can state our own arbitrary decisions and take those of the others at face value. That is not entirely wrong, we cannot "prove" our morality. It’s not a statement to begin with. <a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> But morality is special insofar as :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It is used to decide what to think.</p></li>
<li><p>It can judge itself.</p></li>
<li><p>It is often fragmented.</p></li>
<li><p>It is often bundled with considerations regarding reality, including about the effects some principles have on the world.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And so it is that we can sometimes discover that some parts of our morality are in favor of the destruction of other parts. And because morality doesn’t always disclose the entirety of its conclusions but rather reacts to thoughts, situations and what we believe to be true, these judgments our moralities pass unto themselves can be triggered by situations and argumentations. So no, arguing about morality isn’t entirely pointless.</p>
<p>Arguing morally about morality seems like the kind of thing that whispers its own name in our ear. Seriously, how could I not call this metamorality? <a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
