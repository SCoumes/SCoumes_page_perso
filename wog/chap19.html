<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter can benefit from having read chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a> and having a few notions on the mathematical notion of distance. The "curse of dimensions" <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> is also briefly mentioned. These are however not really needed.</p>
<p>Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline"> ⋆  ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="foreword-4">Foreword</h2>
<p>This chapter is about the notion of links between ideas corresponding to a notion of "distance" on ideas, the notion that ideas can be more or less close to eachothers. The word "propinquity" is not my invention. The Oxford English dictionary gives the following definition "The state of being close to someone or something; proximity.". I simply chose to repurpose the word to my needs. In this chapter, it can loosely be considered to mean "small distance between ideas".<br />
In this chapter, we first discuss the notion of distance on ideas, which corresponds to the theory of propinquity. Then, we consider a few propinquity based effects. First I discuss how propinquity can be used for communication or the transmission of ideas. Then I discuss an effect of thought through which considerations on ideas (like/dislike) can spread through propinquity. This will occupy most of the length of this chapter. The reason the discussion on that point is so long is that it also serves as a first approach to discuss the basic mechanisms to associate a nonconscious estimation to an idea. <a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> <span> Once the topic is further discussed, add a teaser here</span>. The remaining sections handle discussion and conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="idea-propinquity-distance-in-idea-space">Idea Propinquity : distance in idea space ?</h2>
<p>Human often use a notion of distance on ideas. We consider some ideas to be close and often we do not think much about it before declaring that two ideas are close; it is mostly an intuitive process. However, we can be convinced that ideas are close by arguments. Or at least, how close we perceive two ideas to be can be changed by argumentation. Notably, it seems that our vision of how close two ideas are can be changed by pointing out that they are close in a given way that we didn’t think about.<br />
Another interesting property is that ideas that are far away seem to always roughly be at the same distance from each others. Is the idea of "table" more removed from "differential calculus" or from "the roman empire" ? The question feels meaningless. None of them are close and that’s it. This is similar <a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> to the curse of dimensions. Ideas are all at the same distance "by default" and it is special when ideas are close. Ideas that are close can however be more or less close, which I will represent with numerical values <a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> .<br />
So how does this work ? Well, once more I will offer a model to reflect my view of the topic. But first I need a name. This time I chose to go with "idea propinquity", which loosely means "idea proximity". Because I wish to avoid creating homonyms and because I want to give a complete name to the model rather than one of those awkward don’t-design-a-specific-thing kind of names, the name will be slightly longer. <a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> It’s called "wogian theory of idea propinquity". To be said once when needed before simply using the word "propinquity" as applicable.<br />
We use many different distances on ideas, which will be listed in a subsequent section. For now, what matters is that by default all ideas are at the same distance from one another. At any given time, we hold in mind a set of distances to be used. These are the distance we "thought to apply" to the current mental situation. They can also feel more or less important, which is represented by a (positive) coefficient. Given two ideas, the resulting distance between them is given by the following formula, with <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>s</em></span> the set of pairs of a distance and a coefficient (already accounting for the two target ideas), <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em></sub></span> the default distance between ideas, and <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>u</em></sub></span> the resulting distance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$D_{resu} = 1 / [ \frac{1}{M_{max}} + \sum_{(d, a) \in Dists} a * (M_{max} - min(d, M_{max})) ]$$</span></p>
<p><span> Perhaps the explanation of <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>s</em></span> was unclear.</span></p>
<p>The goal of the formula is to express the general properties given by intuition in a clear and concise form. I do not profess to have anything you could use for precise calculations. Here are a few of the hallmark of intuition expressed by the formula :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If no distance says the two ideas are closer than <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em></sub></span> then the distance is <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em></sub></span></p></li>
<li><p>Considering new distances can only bring the ideas closer. This is because what we intuitively measure is "closeness" rather than "distance".</p></li>
<li><p>The distance between two distinct ideas can be arbitrarily small, but never 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The set of distances, the way each individual distance considers the relationship between ideas, and the coefficients can all change depending on variations in the mind. Details are left to future study and intuition, but all these values should be considered as succeptible to change depending on the state of the mind. I would however say that these changes tend to be small within a single mind on a short timescale. They can however be felt heavily when going from one mind to another.<br />
This paragraph is an answer to an objection some inquiring minds could raise. No need to spend time on this if you do not enjoy mathematical scrutiny. One might notice that this formula doesn’t output 0 if the two ideas are equal. Well, it might if <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>s</em></span> is infinite but such that the sum is bounded for all pairs of distinct ideas. Good enough for me, it’s not even that inelegant.</p>
<p>Also, the "resulting distance" is not a distance. It doesn’t satisfy the triangular inequality. This is actually normal, you can notice that the intuitive distances formed by the following idea doesn’t either : "piano playing" <span class="math inline">→</span> "piano reparation" <span class="math inline">→</span> "car reparation". To be honest, I don’t think the smaller individual distances are real distances either. It’s all just functions that tell whether things are similar or not. They do sort of often look like distances on a metric space though.<br />
The model described above does not offer an invariable notion of distance between two ideas. It is vulnerable to changes either in the distances considered and in the values given by the considered distances. Both can be influenced by changes in one’s mindstate. So how come we can usually safely use the notion of "close idea" in conversation without giving any additional precision ? Because the distance between two ideas is often similar across minds. When we estimate that others will give a same measurement of the distance between ideas, we simply refer to "the distance" between the ideas and don’t offer more precision. This is notably helped by cultural similarities. Of course, one can have a tendency to defend the distance given by his mind (or cultural subgroup) as the "right" one. But this leaves the realm of the present considerations and is to be discussed another time.</p>
<h2 id="idea-propinquity-a-few-distances">Idea propinquity : a few distances</h2>
<p>This section will mostly be devoted to a non-exhaustive list of distances used to measure one way ideas can be close each. This will be done one distance at a time, one subsection each. For the sake of my patience, I will try to be brief in each subsection, simply giving intuition in a few words.</p>
<p>However, before we go into this oh-so-fun enumeration process, a first subsection will be devoted to the description of the general process or "distance rating" used in the mind <a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> to give a value to those distances.</p>
<h3 id="distance-rating">Distance rating</h3>
<p>Because I speak so much of distance between ideas in this chapter, it seems appropriate to discuss how those values exist within the mind. So, let’s talk about this : how does it work ?<br />
Well, the idea is simple. The value is stored as an idea within the mind. Please note that this doesn’t have to be a conscious idea, simply an idea.</p>
<p>So when I say that a mind gives value <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to distance <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>1</sub></span> between ideas <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, I really mean that there is an idea within the mind that corresponds to saying "for distance <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>1</sub></span> the distance between <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>".</p>
<h3 id="similarity-of-practical-use">Similarity of practical use</h3>
<p>Ideas can be made closer by being often used in similar concrete situations or for similar uses.</p>
<h3 id="analogy">Analogy</h3>
<p>Ideas can have a similar form, they can be constructed in similar fashions. This is already called analogy by others.</p>
<h3 id="similarity-of-hosting-minds">Similarity of hosting minds</h3>
<p>Ideas can be brought closer by the fact that we know them to be often found in the same minds.</p>
<h3 id="similarity-of-pushed-conclusions">Similarity of pushed conclusions</h3>
<p>Ideas can be brought closer by the fact that they seem to "imply" similar conclusions. This is especially interesting because the preferred way I identify for ideas to push another idea is the process called propinquity bias, which used the notion of distance on ideas. This process is described later in this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="admission-of-a-key-idea">Admission of a key idea</h3>
<p>Some ideas appear as important key ideas that are sometimes said to be "contained" in other ideas. For example, we might say that the idea of "feeding kitten" and the idea of "saving lives" both admit "doing good things" as a key idea. Being a key idea isn’t really a stand alone property of ideas. It’s more that some ideas are key ideas for other ideas.<br />
Ideas a close to their key ideas, and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="common-admission-of-a-key-idea">Common admission of a key idea</h3>
<p>Ideas can be brought closer by the fact that they share a key idea. Rather than considering the existence of a single distance that "counts" how many key ideas two ideas share, I consider that there is one distance per possible key idea the ideas could share. That choice is, however, purely arbitrary.</p>
<h2 id="propinquity-in-bias-and-idea-passation-general-ideas">Propinquity in bias and idea passation : general ideas</h2>
<h3 id="propinquity-in-art-and-speech">Propinquity in art and speech</h3>
<p>Often when fiction, art, and speeches attempt to pass ideas in an indirect fashion we call the process "symbolic". This has lead me in the past to call different process of idea passation and argumentation that feel similar "symbolic". However, this gave mixed results. People do not always understand what I mean by that, and how could I blame them ? There are, in the general case, no symbols. Hence I am technically wrong. This is not "symbolic" and I need to find another way to call this effect. I have. I call it "idea passation through wogian idea propinquity" <a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> or simply "passation by propinquity".</p>
<h3 id="idea-passation-by-propinquity">Idea passation by propinquity</h3>
<p>Despite using uncommon words, idea passation through propinquity is not at all one of those arcane concepts academics have the privilege of brandishing. It simply refer to the process of introducing a mind to ideas through the presentation of other ideas that are close to the idea we wish to introduce. The idea that is introduced is said to be "passed on" to the mind, hence the words "idea passation" in the title of this section.<br />
And that’s it. That’s the idea of idea passation through propinquity. You present other ideas, they all feel close to a specific new idea and so the target’s mind becomes aware of the new idea. The ideas used for the passation can be specifically presented or be more implicit. They can for example be contained within the context of the situation, or be introduced through propinquity themselves.</p>
<h3 id="propinquity-bias">Propinquity bias</h3>
<p>What’s the idea of propinquity bias ? It’s that ideas that are close to each others can influence one another. There are ideas we like and we tend to like more the ideas that are close to ideas we like. The closer the ideas are and the more we like the first one, the more this will tend to make us like the second idea.</p>
<h2 id="propinquity-bias-lets-be-more-specific">Propinquity bias : let’s be more specific</h2>
<h3 id="the-fundamentals">The fundamentals</h3>
<p>The core idea of propinquity bias is this : our considerations regarding some ideas can spread to ideas that are close to them in our mind. Specifically, I would say that ideas mostly influence how much we like other ideas, with respect to how much we like the ideas doing the influencing. We like new ideas that are close to ideas we like and dislike those that are close to ideas we dislike.<br />
I would say that I am describing a subprocesse or a collection of subprocesse that give rise to the effect I name. In other words, I am describing a kind of thought pattern that is very common to universal among human minds. Because this effect is not conscious and because there is no reason to believe it is automatically correct (and indeed, I believe it is not), I am calling it a bias. Hence the name : "idea propinquity bias" or "propinquity bias" for short.<br />
When a new idea is introduced to the mind, propinquity bias can appear and influence our perception of the new idea. However, I would also say that propinquity bias can be triggered in other circumstances. For example, we might wonder what happens when our opinion of the influencing ideas changes. Do the ideas they once influenced keep their "rating" or does the change of opinion spread across propinquity links ? I leave these questions for another time. For now, I will simply say that there are times when we can suffer from propinquity bias and that it is at least relatively common.<br />
At the reader will notice, I am describing a notion of "simple estimation of ideas" alongside the notion of propinquity bias. The reason is simple : propinquity bias relies on it. As this chapter posits, humans have a basic system to attribute a "score" to ideas (which is not necessarily a single numerical value). This score, or more generally this stored information, serves as our base notion of whether or not we like the idea. It is currently my belief that the human mind is acceptably modeled by saying that we keep such a tab and use it in various thought patterns.</p>
<h3 id="hunting-for-a-good-representation">Hunting for a good representation</h3>
<p>So we have ideas in mind, they are in a certain state with respect to our appreciation (mostly we like them or not) and then, sometimes, they can influence how much we like other ideas. But how does this work ? Seems like we need more details.</p>
<p>Contrary to what I have often done in the previous chapters, I believe I should offer the series of thought experiments I went through to fix my ideas. However, I deem this just interesting and not necessary to understand to conclusion I arrive at. If you don’t care to read all this, simply skip to the last paragraph in this subsection. As it turns out, I have mostly focused on the representation of the opinion we have of ideas. The starting point is as follows. Sometimes we like or dislike ideas strongly and sometimes we care a lot about ideas (we say they are important to us). Are those two things the same ?<br />
Here is the first idea : use a single value. Let’s consider an idea <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. We attach to <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> a single value -which can be positive or negative- that represents how much we like it. If the value is high, we like the idea <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> (and it is important to us). If it is low (in the negatives), we dislike it (and it is important to us). And if the value is close to 0, then we don’t care very much about the idea <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. When an idea <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> is influenced (typically if <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> is a new idea presented to our mind), the value associated with it is influenced by the value associated with <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> with respect to how close <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is to <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>. A graphic representation of this arcane idea can be found in figure <a href="#ChapPropinFigExp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapPropinFigExp1">20.1</a>.</p>
<p>This representation is countered by the example of slavery in a foreign and distant country. Let’s consider an imaginary country called Evilistan, ruled by the dreadlord Zargotrox. In Evilistan, slavery is very common and the slaves are very poorly treated. I estimate that how much we dislike things admits a maximum value, to which I will now give the pet name "MaxHate". Let’s say that you dislike slavery to a level close to "MaxHate". <a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> But Evilistan is also very far away, and so it doesn’t feel very important. Yes, you hate slavery. But slavery existing in Evilistan is not a driving force in your life. However, imagine that suddenly you see slaves in front of you, or you learn that some Evilistan trader brought a little bit of slave misery down the street. Then, the hatred you have for slavery feels more important. You mind is more strongly influenced by it. This is true even though your opinion of slavery hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>You might disagree with me that this evolution of state of mind is realistic. It feels possible to me, so for now I will simply admit that much and move on.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Propinquity_1.png" id="ChapPropinFigExp1" alt="First case data representation" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">First case data representation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the previous thought experiment, we gather that importance and extremeness of appreciation must be two distinct values in our model. Indeed, suppose that your opinion on slavery itself exercises some influence on other ideas. For example, it might reduce your tendency to buy some products which have a chain of production "tainted" by slavery. <a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> Hence, the way an <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> influences <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> is dependent on the importance of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> in a way that is not proportionate to the extremeness <a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> of the mind’s appreciation of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. So one value doesn’t work. Let’s try two.<br />
So second try, we store one value that can go into the negative for how much the mind likes <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> and a second value that is always positive for how important <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is to the mind. The influence of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> on how much the mind appreciates <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> is a function of both values in <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. The influence of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> on how important <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> is to the mind is a function of how important <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is to the mind. Let’s visualize in figure <a href="#ChapPropinFigExp2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapPropinFigExp2">20.2</a>, and then we will discuss what is wrong with that representation.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Propinquity_2.png" id="ChapPropinFigExp2" alt="Second case data representation" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Second case data representation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s say that once again you are contemplating whether or not to buy products that were produced in Evilistan. Under the direct supervision of dreadlord Zargotrox, no less. This time all the slaves are still in the distant Evilistan and you feel positively unaffected. The matter is not important to you, but you would still rather avoid buying Evilistian products. But now mister Scruffle, your beloved cat, while he was on a vacation alone in Randomcountrystant, got into a mortal danger. Randomcountrystant is a neighboring country to Evilistan, and luckily Zargotrox saw the situation and saved mister Scruffle. The cat was then returned to you safely. How should this make your tendency to buy Evilistian products evolve ?</p>
<p>Well let’s assume that your opinion of slavery and of Evilistan remains at MaxHate (or very close). Saving mister Scruffle should improve the importance of Evilistan, not decrease it. Hence, then the influence of the idea of Evilistan on the idea "buying Evilistian products" should increase but not change in nature (negative). Thus, Zargotrox saving mister Scruffle should increase your hatred of Evilistian products. This is however completely counterintuitive. Saving Scruffle should improve your fondness for Evilistan, which should oppose your other negative considerations. Hence, intuition dictates that your tendency to buy Evilistian products should increase, not decrease.<br />
This tells us that the previous representation is incorrect and guides us toward the next idea I had, separating positive considerations (fondness) and negative considerations (aversion). Notably, we are about to double the number of numerical values per idea again.<br />
So, we are using four values per idea. We have a value for positive importance, one for positive appreciation, one for negative importance (importance related to negative appreciation), and one for negative appreciation. Influence works as in the previous representation, except it is specialized by "positivity". Values for positive appreciation influence values for positive appreciation and likewise for negativity. Once again, a friendly picture (figure <a href="#ChapPropinFigExp3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapPropinFigExp3">20.3</a>) will help us visualize before we discuss.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Propinquity_3.png" id="ChapPropinFigExp3" alt="Third case data representation" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Third case data representation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, what’s wrong this time ? Well, what happens if I crank all values to the maximum on idea <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> ? How does <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> influences <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>, does it always has a neutral outcome ? Always except if one of the value reaches its maximum on <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>? Intuitively, getting all settings to the maximal value feels forbidden. We certainly have the possibility to strongly like and dislike something at the same time (we then feel conflicted). But we should still retain the ability to be affected by propinquity then. If influence can only increase value, this no longer works. So perhaps the system should allow cross influence to allow for negativity to influence a reduction of positivity (and vice-versa). But then we need additional information to explain how this solves the last thought experiment.</p>
<p>And anyway this string of refinements feels like adding too much complexity for the base goal. The model is supposed to help create understanding and give a clearer view of the effect at hand. It is not supposed to be perfect or even accurately predictive.<br />
Thus, I give up on the search of a precis satisfying approximation. We will simply go back to a simpler representation and use a nice "black box" abstraction to handle complexity.</p>
<p>The state associated with ideas in the mind is complex and stores a lot of information. However at any given moment the influence of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> on <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> depends on only one value on <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> which behaves as the sole value of the first representation explored in this section. In other words, ideas receive influence in a complex manner and a lot of information is stored to determine how much we like them. But they always influence the rest of our mind as if we only rated them on one scale going from "hate " to "don’t care" to love. The way the inside information is converted into this value is context dependent.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-about-a-few-main-ideas-or-about-nets-of-ideas">Is this about a few main ideas or about nets of ideas ?</h3>
<p>A question we might ask is "how is the effect described about most commonly important "? Is it mostly about a few cornerstone ideas, doing most of the influencing on other ideas ? Or is it more about nets of ideas, in which many ideas influence one another to produce a coherent whole ? The second case isn’t necessarily weaker. In fact, it seems to be more resilient to change, when it happens.<br />
I would say that both answers can be correct, depending on the topic. We sometimes let a strong idea influence many others (think of fanboyism for example). But it also seems true that we sometimes form nets of ideas that influence one another and such that even if we absolutely have to change our mind on one the others still exerce their influence.<br />
My estimation is that the second one is more frequent than we think. But at this point, this is just intuition.</p>
<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
<p>This section will be quick. The last one was long so I believe a short one will be enjoyable. Let’s go over the vocabulary introduced in this chapter. We might even introduce a litlle more.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="idea-propinquity">Idea propinquity</h3>
<p>I took the already existing but uncommon word "propinquity", which loosely translate to "closeness" or "proximity" and I applied it to my purpose. I use it to talk about ideas being close to one another. Thus, I call my description of the distance between ideas a "theory of idea propinquity".<br />
Also, every process that relies on a proximity relation on ideas can be said to work "by propinquity". I expect that this will be useful to me in the future.</p>
<h3 id="distance-on-ideas">Distance on ideas</h3>
<p>I spoke about the idea that ideas can be more or less close to one another. I used the notion of "distance" between ideas and I listed some specific types of distances. All of this, I tied to the sometimes used notion of "distance on idea space", even thought what I described does not really match the definition of distance in mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="idea-passation-through-propinquity">Idea passation through propinquity</h3>
<p>I spoke of the possibility to communicate ideas using propinquity and I called that "idea passation through propinquity".</p>
<h3 id="propinquity-bias-1">Propinquity bias</h3>
<p>I introduced a kind of thought pattern that I consider potentially negative that relies on propinquity. I called it propinquity bias.<br />
For those who wish to distance themselves from the pejorative word "bias", I now offer an alternative. The thought pattern corresponding to propinquity bias can also be called "idea value influence through propinquity". I suppose you could ditch the "idea" to shorten it a bit. To the countrary, if you think there could be some ambiguity as to what you are talking about, I advise to add "the wogian notion of" in front of the name.</p>
<h3 id="liking-ideas">Liking ideas</h3>
<p>The same section used to describe propinquity bias also describes how information is stored in nonconscious processes regarding our assessment of ideas. I simply call this "intuitively liking" or "intuitively disliking" an idea.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-this-model-issues-of-the-effect">Limitations of this model, issues of the effect</h2>
<p><span> A discussion for the future : should the existence of propinquity bias make us think that some ideas are "bad to like" ?</span></p>
<p>The notions presented in this chapter admit a few limitations and raise a few questions. This section is made to discuss them. I will do so one point at a time, one paragraph each.<br />
I used the word bias for the notion I called "Propinquity bias", which is a word we tend to use when we consider a thought pattern to be wrong. In this case, I will say that I do consider this pattern to be untrustworthy and pernicious. Hence, I stand by my decision to use the word "bias". However, that doesn’t mean the pattern is always bad and should be avoided at all cost. It seems somewhat efficient and important to some extent to the construction of our tastes. One of the main issues of propinquity bias is still that liking an idea that is a statement is similar to "tending to consider it true". Hence, propinquity bias allows for estimations on how much we like a thing to be converted to estimations on truth.<br />
<span> TODO : Discuss our basic intuitive relationship to truth.</span><br />
The model of distance presented feels "hackish" and also a little inelegant. To my intuition, it looks like a bad approximation of a "cleaner" truth.<br />
Likewise, the model used for propinquity bias uses a central black box <a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> , which gravely limitates our understanding of it. I believe I gave up on increasing complexity at the right time; the thread I was following would probably only have been concluded by a description much above my means in term of precision. However, the black box is still somewhat unsatisfying.<br />
Overall, the system I have described as propinquity bias is probably only an approximation of a part of the effects of a greater system. A more complex one, covering more effects and parts of human behavior as a string of subprocesses working in synergy.<br />
This last point is not so much a limitation as a disclaimer. The goal of the part of the description that concerns propinquity bias is only to describe that specific kind of bias. It is perfectly normal that this chapter does not describe other biases, even if they use the notion of liking ideas I developed in this chapter.</p>
