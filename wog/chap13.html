<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter requires to have a general understanding of the notions introduced in chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a> and a basic understanding of the notions of kirkin, kirkinplex, and degree of meaning (as introduced in chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>).<br />

</div>
<h2 id="foreword-2">Foreword</h2>
<p>The previous chapter left me in a somewhat comfortable position to talk about the way humans cogitate. In this chapter, I will specifically study the notion of rigor. More than the general notion, I am interested by a specific idea of rigor : it is the one used by the mathematician that claims an argument or a proof "lacks rigor". I however apply that kind of rigor to forms of cogitation that clearly falls outside of the scope of mathematics, such as for example political ones. Thus, the notion of rigor I explore will need to be able to be more relaxed when the situation requires it. I will call it "Wogian Cogitative Rigor".<br />
This notion comes from a personal introspection on the topic of rigor. Rigor has been, in the last few years, an import notion for me when I thought about how one is supposed to "think right". I simply called it rigor while being aware of the fact that more than one idea bears that name in the society I live in. It was to me obvious to some extend that this "rigor" was important and often, but perhaps not always, is required to produce a valid thought process. Indeed, a lack of "rigor" has been for me a valid reason to dismiss some argumentation and mental constructions. At its heart, this chapter is an attempt on my part both at clarifying this notion and at analyzing the reason to use it.<br />
All of my explanations consider the context of cogitation, which I only defined for a single mind. However that notion can be intuitively extended to other situations. Indeed, many situations -such as a group of people thinking cooperatively- can be seen as having a corresponding idea bishing equivalent to that of a single mind’s cogitation. This paves the way to an approximation that considers these situations equivalent to a single mind cogitating. I will not make additional efforts regarding group thinking and other situations similar to cogitation in this chapter, but you can bear in mind that the notion of rigor can be applied to more situations than presented here. Some of them will be explored in later chapters but I will also say a few words here in section <a href="#ChaptRCSecext" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChaptRCSecext">14.5</a>.<br />
As I will state in this chapter, wogian rigor requires an idea of "dosage of a quality". This will require to be explained at the same time as the reasons to use wogian rigor. A good analogy would be that of the use of a water pitcher. Suppose you have to explain at the same time what a water pitcher is, how to use it, and the point of its use. You might describe separately the instruction for use "pour water in the glass until it is full" and the point "to fill the glass", but that feels somewhat absurd. For the pitcher, the explanations are short enough that this is acceptable, but an issue is apparent.</p>
<p>I find myself in a similar bind in section <a href="#ChaptRCSecDosage" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChaptRCSecDosage">14.4</a> and will therefore fuse the explanations regarding goals and dosage.</p>
<h2 id="weak-cogitative-rigor">Weak Cogitative Rigor</h2>
<p>My general considerations on the notion of rigor will be elaborated upon in chapter <a href="#ChapRigorGene" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorGene">15</a>. For now, I will simply say that these consideration lead me to the following definition of "Weak Cogitation Rigor". "Weak Cogitation Rigor" is the property of tunal cogitation that limitates its corresponding bishing to a certain set of rules. To the question "how tunal" I will answer "enough to ensure every other requirement through control".<br />
Stronger kinds of rigor can be introduced by specifying the set of rules used. All in all, secondary kinds of rigor should all imply weak rigor.</p>
<h2 id="wogian-cogitative-rigor">Wogian Cogitative Rigor</h2>
<p>What I call Wogian Rigor is centered around two central elements : a list of rules and the idea of sufficient meaning.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the list of rules. Wogian Cogitative Rigor is a form of weak rigor and hence limitates its corresponding bishing to a specific set of rules. Even thought they are a part of the definition, the rules listed correspond to my belief that they help to give certain guarantees regarding the validity of the cogitative process. Hence, they are subject to change under examination of new rules and old ones alike. In a way, one could say that such a process can change what wogian rigor is, causing it to evolve.</p>
<p>Also, wogian rigor is the kind of concept that one can be said to be using to different degrees. Limiting the bishing to a subset of the rules (and a list of rules you shall have) can sometimes be said to be "more rigorous". I will not attempt to explain or list now which subsets are the more rigorous ones and how one can quantify how rigorous a cogitation is. The goal is to lay down a reasonably clear view of the nature and purpose of wogian rigor, not to give the kind of precision required to rebuild it in details exactly as I would use it. The following list of rules is, most certainly, incomplete.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The rules of logic</p></li>
<li><p>Rules derived from probability theory</p></li>
<li><p>Case disjunction</p></li>
<li><p>General mathematically valid reasoning</p></li>
<li><p>Reified use of honed instincts</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-approved heuristics and estimations</p></li>
<li><p>Sub-reflection</p></li>
<li><p>General pre-approved principles (example : induction principle)</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptable rational processes not based on the "construction of truth"</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The second part of wogian rigor, perhaps the one that can best encompass the core idea of this form of rigor, is the requirement for ideas to have enough meaning. This one is much simpler to explain, thanks to the previous work on the notion of kirkin. It is a requirement that all ideas used either as "entries" or "products" in the cogitation’s corresponding bishing have a corresponding kirkin with a high enough degree of meaning. Especially, we might consider it a requirement on the lower bound of the degree of meaning of all such kirkins; even though we can look more closely at the general distribution of meaning across all idea’s corresponding kirkins. Insofar as we use ideas that are expressed through models, the requirement of meaning is especially strong on the kirkinplexes that correspond to those models. One strong point of importance of that meaning is the completeness of the models corresponding to the kirkinplexes.</p>
<p>This felt really good to write compared to what I said on the limitations on rules. I love having readied vocabulary.<br />
As we have seen, there are two ways in which a cogitative process that attempts wogian rigor can be more or less "rigorous" : the subset of rules used and the degrees of meaning of ideas. The required dosage process is explored along with the point of wogian rigor in section <a href="#ChaptRCSecDosage" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChaptRCSecDosage">14.4</a>.<br />
A quick remark. Rule 9 corresponds to the reconstruction under the guise of rules of processes that do not follow the structure of a mathematical proof. A good example might be that of "the examination of all arguments on a specific topic". This can be reconstructed by having rules which produce "token" that express the idea that a point was examined and a conclusion rule that "collects" the tokens and a list of all required tokens to provide the conclusion that all listed points have been examined.</p>
<h2 id="ChaptRCSecDosage">Dosage and reason to exist</h2>
<p>As a way to make this chapter easier to read, I will now attempt to give a clear and brief summary of the core ideas it rests upon.</p>
<p>The point of the rule restrictions is that they are supposed to give us some certainties regarding the validity of our cogitation. The point of the meaning is twofold : it is seen as virtuous in itself and required for the rules to give us their aforementioned guarantees. The variation in the required degree of application of these two pillars of wogian rigor comes both from the nature of the topics, which can require the rules used to be more or less drastic, and from the desired degree of certainty and control over the results. Maximal certainty is not always possible in the context in which we cogitate due to the nature of the questions humans tend to be interested in.<br />
Regarding the rules used, most of what needs to be said was already said in the paragraph above. The choice of the rules comes from a statement (a belief) regarding the structural nature of the truth function <span class="math inline"><em>T̃</em></span> . Given a specific desire for knowledge or simply a topic, the choice of the subset of rules at hand is determined by the guarantees desired concerning the validity of the cogitation and by the ideas we intend to handle. A common such desire and indeed guarantee we hope that rules give us is the following "if the premises are true and the rules have been correctly applied, then the conclusions are also true".<br />
Often, the rules will require that the ideas used have minimal degrees of meaning to "work". Notably, rules that touch to the link ideas have with the models they are expressed in might required that these models be meaningful enough.</p>
<p>It is sometimes the case that the rules intuitively present their own limitations, such that they can simply not be misused. However, some other times, the meaning needed for a rule to give us its desired guarantees are not obvious. When that is the case, it is especially important that we be careful to think with ideas meaningful enough for the purpose of our cogitation. In other words : the more we use intuition based rules, the more we are likely to make mistakes through a lack of meaning.</p>
<p>It is not rare that the rules we use do not allow to gain meaning in the conclusion compared to the entries. Hence, considering the degree of meaning of the final question, it can happen that the need for meaning recursively "chains" through the cogitation steps.</p>
<p>I would also say that using ideas that are meaningful enough and especially models that are complete enough has an other virtue. Part of it comes from the idea that making it a habit to use meaningful ideas can naturally help with future cogitation, granting rigor by reflex. However, I would also say that I have come to see it as having moral value in itself.<br />
We cannot always maximize meaning or use only rules that give us the best of guarantees for the simple reason that, at the time of writing, we cannot turn all the questions we care about to realms of perfect meaning. Hence, we can find ourselves confronted with the converse of the chain effect mentioned above. Because the final question is limited in meaning, it can be hard to have rules that allow to reach a satisfying answer while limitating themselves to high degrees of meaning. This can sometimes offer an upper bound to the degree of meaning used.<br />
Lastly, please note that this section uses the phrasing "the reasons" and then gives lists of reasons. This does not necessarily mean that I claim these are the only reasons to use wogian rigor. It is more that these are the general reasons that I see as the most universal, and also the ones required I however do believe that there can be other reasons to use rigor. Notably, there are situations in which the processes corresponding to the rules we use through wogian rigor are efficient ways to handle problems. Beyond the simple gain of guarantees, rigor can also produce better results on average <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> .</p>
<h2 id="ChaptRCSecext">Extension beyond single mind cogitation</h2>
<p>As I have noted above, the concept of wogian rigor can be extended beyond cogitations that use a single mind. Beyond the requirement for tunality, wogian rigor is defined with regard to the idea bishing corresponding to the cogitation. Hence, we can easily extend it to various processes to which we can assign a form of idea bishing. I would like to point out that the notion of "corresponding idea bishing" was not perfectly defined. This will remain so in the following extensions, even thought the general idea of this correspondence relation will hopefully be obvious.<br />
A first very easily understood extension is the transmission of an argument or, in all generality, of a string of thoughts. This can be a written account, a speech, or any other form of communication chosen. However, many forms of communication do not transmit ideas that are meaningful enough for rigor. A given expressive dance may well pass a great deal of ideas, but I do not know of one that is remotely close to the kind of "meaningful ideas" needed in rigor.</p>
<p>The second extension I think of is the collaboration of multiple minds. Here, the notion of rationality must be extended as an understanding by the member of the structure of the joint effort. However, the main idea remains. As long as an appropriate idea bishing is created consciously <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> , we can use the previous definition of rigor.<br />
When we say that a cogitation "lacks rigor" in the implicit context of wogian rigor, we mean that it is not rigorous enough for its goal. Of course, the goal in question is more often than not implicit. Indeed, the goal is not necessarily fixed at the time the string of ideas was created. We might read an old book and say that it is not rigorous enough to be of use to us because we ourselves require strong guarantees. That is perfectly acceptable, even if the original author only aimed to produce vague intuition <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> .</p>

<li id="fn34" role="doc-endnote"><p>One may think of the case of complex subjects for which a long cogitation is required. If the model is that of a string of steps that each have the same odd of being correct, then the probability that the whole chain is correct decreases exponentially.
