<h2 id="foreword-1">Foreword</h2>
<h2 id="having-ideas-and-using-ideoplexes">Having ideas and using ideoplexes</h2>
<p><span> Much of this section is redundant with chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>, downright copy/pasted.</span></p>
<h3 id="ideas-and-ideoplexes-are-mind-objects">Ideas and ideoplexes are mind objects</h3>
<p>A described in chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>, the human mind often makes use of ideas and ideoplexes (the later often being models).</p>
<p>They both are a specific kind of mind object, meaning they can be stored in certain parts of the mind. Specifically, they can be stored (or contained) in memory or in the "thoughts" part of the surface (see model of the human mind in chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>).</p>
<p>I see no good way to describe in abstract terms what an idea is, but I am relying on the fact that the concept of idea is intuitive and well known. Hence, I only took care of some of the integration into the model of the human mind I use. As for models (or more generally ideoplexes), the best phrasing I found to help convey intuition is the following "ideoplexes are reified contexts within the mind through which some ideas gain their meaning".<br />
I now wish to introduce the concept of "idea construct". They are a relatively simple way to put into words an idea that has been important for me for quite some time. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> So what are they ? Well even though this will yet again fall short of a proper definition, I think they deserve to have a little description box.</p>
<div class="defi">
<p><strong>Definition 11.1</strong> (Idea construct).  <em>An idea construct is a structured set of ideas forming a whole that is equivalent to a single complex idea.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Having a word for them is important to me because I consider that the goal of many activities is to produce idea construct that have certain properties. Once again, we implicitly <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> introduce the corresponding notion of kirkin construct. Also, the language abuse confusing an idea construct with the corresponding kirkin construct is to be tolerated. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Because ideas are "created" whereas kirkins are atemporal, we will also tolerate the confusion on whether idea constructs are created or described/discovered.</p>
<h3 id="having-imperfect-ideas-and-ideoplexes">Having imperfect ideas and ideoplexes</h3>
<p>So, ideas and ideoplexes are present as objects in various parts of our minds. Great. But what about those time we "almost have an idea" ? Or when we have an idea but are still unclear on the details and later on we say we have a clearer view of our own idea ? There are also situations in which we say that we "have an idea" but in truth we mostly have a feeling that we should act in a certain way. The idea is not really conscious in our thoughts.<br />
The first part of my answer is that the idea that are considered to be presently in our mind (so not the ones currently stored in memory) are determined by the state of the "thoughts" part of the surface. In other words, the ideas presently in our mind are within our awareness. There are not ideas that are "partially" or "almost" in our mind. <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Everything related to the aforementioned issues is handled through the lack of meaning of ideas. <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> When we almost have an idea but we feel like we are not set on a specific idea, I consider that the idea we have in mind is a very low meaning one corresponding to the idea "idea X, or idea Y, or ...".<br />
It is sometimes the case that an idea we have is obviously a lesser version of an other idea. That is for example the case when an idea is "on the tip of our tongue". In such case, we will tolerate the language abuse that considers two different ideas to be the same provided that they are similar to one another and that one is more meaningful than the other. We say that we clarified an idea were we might more truthfully say that we moved from an idea to a different and clearer one.</p>
<h2 id="the-abstraction-dichotomy">The abstraction dichotomy</h2>
<p>The notion of abstraction is often quite vague <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> , and at the same time important insofar as it seems that abstract thoughts have some interesting qualities. When I chose to dwell on the concept, I noticed that the principal definition found in dictionaries do not really match with a kind of common use of the word encountered when we say "that’s abstract" of things that are complicated in a certain fashion. That second use was described in some forms, but never in a way that entirely satisfied me.</p>
<p>I reached the conclusions that there are two main kinds of abstraction (hereafter referred to as <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstractions). <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> I would say that the reason for my initial confusion is that the main way for many to encounter <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction is through <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction. Hence, they can tend to be seen as the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-abstraction"><span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction</h3>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction correspond to the prominent definition I found in dictionaries. It defines both a process of abstraction and resulting ideas (which are called "abstract"). <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction is the process of extracting structural characteristics present among one or several ideas as a way to produce an idea construct that can be used to understand said ideas.</p>
<p>Often, the ideas with which the process starts, which are said to be abstracted, are the direct correspondent to some particular instances of the general idea we reach. We can then say that the process of abstraction corresponds to the determination of the structural common nature of the instances.</p>
<div class="ex">
<p><strong>Example 11.1</strong>.  <em>We might look as several different kinds of boat and reach the general idea "boat". In that case, we have abstracted the ideas of the instances in the "abstract" idea of boat.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Of course, we tolerate in such cases the language abuse that confuses the real life things with the idea of the things. So we can say that we have an abstraction that is the common idea of all boats, rather than of all the ideas of boat. I offer a name for this specific form of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction, albeit not a pretty one :" extraction of shared structural properties".<br />
I would say that the extraction of shared structural properties is central to many ideas which fundamentally exist through it. What I mean by that is that some idea enter our mind as "the property shared by all elements of set X" and that when we wish to define them, the most direct way to do so would simply be to say "the abstraction of the common property of elements of set X" rather than to attempt a description through other means.</p>
<p>This of course begs the question : what does it mean for an idea to be found in various elements of a set. If you show me a pair of boats, the common idea seems to be boat. Why isn’t it the idea "either being boat 1 or boat 2", since that would be more precise ? Why not, if we are to go the other way, "being made of wood", since that is a valid description ?</p>
<p>The question here seems to be related to the core notion of structure and of the right way to partition a given thing into ideas. For now, I will simply say that the notion is certainly arbitrary and culture dependent. Hence, we cannot say we have a rigorously defined deterministic operation corresponding to the extraction of shared structural properties.<br />
Also please note that this form of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction is not the only one.</p>
<h3 id="beta-abstraction"><span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction</h3>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction correspond to the common use of the word "abstract" when reacting to a certain kind of complicated things. It is however not reserved for things that seem complicated and I do not want to give the impression that <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction is only used to describe what one does not understand.<br />
Contrary to <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> abstraction, which is defined by a process, <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction is defined by the status of the thoughts considered. One’s ideas can be said to be <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstract if they have a high degree of meaning and one’s thinking is tunal. In other words, a <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction is an idea that is clear in the mind of a thinker that is aware of his own thoughts. The difference between just any idea an a <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> abstraction, beyond the degree of meaning, is that the thinker is aware of the presence of the idea, rather than only aware of its content.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-ideas">The importance of ideas</h2>
<p>Now, I would like to ask a question that might seem stupid : how are ideas useful to humans ? I have until now only described how they are present and given some vocabulary to speak about. I think it is worth it to think a bit about our relationship to ideas and what they are to us, even if we only end up with answers we could have easily guessed.<br />
First, I will say that ideas are important to the functionment of many subprocesses and more generally of many patterns of thoughts. I would also say that those tend to be the "best" (read : most trustworthy) patterns of thoughts. As such, ideas are simply useful thought resources (or perhaps tools).<br />
Most importantly, ideas are important both to our identity and our view of the word. We think what is most important and central to our existence with ideas and I would say that a mind that does not use ideas at all wouldn’t be human. To some extent, awareness of our ideas is central to our existence. That is very similar to awareness of our own awareness, which itself is similar to self awareness, even thought these notions are all different.<br />
I have in the past been tempted to consider that a human mind in centered on a great idea construct of reality in the context of which its thoughts take place. I would still tend to say that minds require a collection of idea constructs depicting the mind’s "vision of reality". However, I do not believe that a mind is necessarily built upon a single unified construct. Notably, I do not believe that minds require their ideas to form a coherent or complete whole.</p>
<p>Ideas and large reality describing constructs are very important to thought and their presence is central to our own existence as minds. But they are still simply things that are needed for the functionment of a system, which operates by using them according to how the system is structured. As such, I should not <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> feel surprise at the existence of contradiction and incompleteness.</p>
