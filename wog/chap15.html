<h1 id="ChapTheseus">The boat of Theseus</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter admits the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General understanding of chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>General understanding of the notion of model briefly discussed in chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline"> ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this short chapter, I will try to tackle the problem often presented through the story of the boat of Theseus. If you don’t know who Theseus was, simply keep in mind that he lived a long time ago and that his name is somewhat famous.</p>
<p>In his days Theseus had a ship made of wood, which was later brought on land in a museum. As the years went by some of the wooden parts began to rot and were replaced by new ones; then, after a century or so, every part had been replaced. The question then is if the "restored" ship is still the same object as the original.<br />
If it is, then suppose the removed pieces were stored in a warehouse, and after the century, technology was developed that cured their rot and enabled them to be reassembled into a ship? Is this "reconstructed" ship the original ship? If it is, then what about the restored ship in the harbor still being the original ship as well? <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a><br />
This story obviously questions the notion of identity, extended beyond individuals and to objects. I am however interested by a question slightly greater than the one that immediately comes to mind. I am more interested by the study of the identity of an instance of a general idea than the identity of a singular artifact. By that, I mean that I care about the fact that Theseus’s boat is a boat, and I wonder what it means to be "a boat" with respect to the general notion of boat. In other words : what does it mean to be an instance of the notion of boat ?</p>
<p>The story of the boat of Theseus asks the question of the identify of a specific construct, but it asks it in the specific context of the evolution of the object through time and a variety of states. I agree that this is the main context in which the question becomes problematic and in which we must look for answers more complex than the ones we naturally form. What is an integer ? Any element of <span class="math inline">ℕ</span>. If you allow me the context of the ZFC set theory the question poses no problem. But what is a boat ? Contrary to popular intuition, I cannot simply define the boat as a specific arrangement of matter, for the arrangement can change without challenging the idea that it is the same boat. Indeed, our understanding of the identity of the boat should give a clear distinction between the "boat" and the "state of the boat".<br />
I will attempt to give a clearer view of the situation at hand when we consider an instance of a general idea, using the pre-established context of kirkins and kirkinplexes. First, let’s do this without time. The "general idea", as I called it above, corresponds to a kirkinplex. It is not exactly the kirkin "boat", but is it very similar and linked with that kirkin. Because I have allowed the language abuse that confuses the terms of kirkin theory and those from the wogian model of the mind, we could also say that the "general idea" is a "model". I will stick with the vocabulary of kirkin theory but I feel it is important to keep that duality in mind.</p>
<p>The "boat" kirkinplex requires the context of a larger kirkinplex, used as a model of a part of the basis, to make sens. For example, we need pre-attributed meanings to the notions of "wood", "position", and "nails". The particular instance that is the "boat of Theseus" is a kirkin, which is evaluated in the context of the "boat" kirkinplex. This evaluation requires a binding, which captures the idea that the "boat of Theseus" is an instance of the "boat" kirkinplex. Of course, the way the kirkin "boat of Theseus" is bound to the kirkinplex "boat" should be compatible with both of these kirkins.</p>
<p>Now if we wish to include time into our description, we do not need to renounce anything that was just said, be we do require a few additional precision. Our larger kirkinplex should now include a description of time as well. To keep everything simple, let’s say we use discrete linear time. The "boat" kirkinplex should take into account the notion of time, it gives a description of what a boat is as something that evolves through time. Likewise, the instance "boat of Theseus" has to be "designed" (in a very loose sense) for this "boat" kirkinplex that includes time. Once again, the binding captures the instanciation. We might say that the answer to the question prompted by the story of the boat of Theseus is contained with the final bound kirkin. Because of the nature of time based kirkinplexes, we can state a specific part of the world, at a particular point in time, as a "state" of the "boat of Theseus". This is a statement linked with the basis <span class="math inline"><em>Ḃ</em></span>.<br />
To recap, the process we describe when using time has four parts.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The model of boat</p></li>
<li><p>The instance of the model</p></li>
<li><p>The state of the instance</p></li>
<li><p>The basis and the larger model (seen as a whole)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that I have avoided the question prompted by the story and, in a way, you are right. But the point of this chapter was more to get a good representation of the use of models, instances, and states within the framework I am producing. Also, I will remind that as I introduced them, evaluated kirkins can have various degrees of meaning. This lack of meaning can express that the details of the connection between and instance of a model and reality are vague and only stays acceptably meaningful as long as situations do not become too weird. When they do, better more complete kirkins and kirkinplexes must be employed to regain meaning <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> .</p>

<li id="fn40" role="doc-endnote"><p>In the context of ideas and the model of the human mind, this also means that sometimes situations "break" a model and that in such situations a better model must be put in place. This can sometimes only require to get back to a larger model that uses less approximations, but can also mean that a new "choice" of model must be made.<a href="#fnref40" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
