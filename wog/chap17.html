<h1 id="ChapMapAndTerritory">Map and Territory</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has no real requirement. It is however closely linked with chapter <a href="#Chaptruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Chaptruth">[Chaptruth]</a></p>
<p>Estimated need for active reading: <span class="math inline"> ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<p>The "map and territory" metaphor comes from the book "Map and Territory" by Eliezer Yudkowsky <span class="citation" data-cites="MapAndTerritory"></span>. Despite being its title, it is not the central idea of the book and I am sure the author is far from the first to mention it. Still, that’s where I got it.</p>
<p>But what is the idea ? "Map" is a metaphor for represention, the map and territory distinction is the distinction between a model and what it modelizes. "The map is not the territory". <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a><br />
And here is the important idea here : when humans think, they mostly think in the context of "maps" and refer to elements within those maps. Let’s take an example from the context in which the metaphore takes its source, let’s look at an actual map and an actual territory.<br />
Imagine we are both in a city you don’t know and I tell you (over the phone) "let’s meet in Placeholder square". "Placeholder square" isn’t an objective property of reality, not even a local one situated at the appropriate location. "Placeholder square" is meaningful in the context of the map of the city <a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> and it is because you know of a link between the map and real life that you know what to do in real life (go to the appropriate location).</p>
<p>And sometimes, we use maps of maps. Again, let’s stay litteral, just a little longer. I no longer tell you to go to tibidu square. Now I tell you "go to the yellow district and then we will meet". So you look at your map and you find that on the back you have a second map that indeed splits the town in color coded districts. But this second map doesn’t show streets, online the outline of districts. So you first look at the second map to get a rough idea of where yellow district is, then you look at your first map to know which street to use, and then you move in the appropriate direction (which might not be straight ahead toward yellow district). In that example, we might say that the second map is a map of the first.<br />
I think now is an appropriate time to look at a couple other examples, using less litteral "maps". A theory of physics is a map of "the nature of reality" <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> and an organigram is a map of a set of people. That second example is especially interesting because is shows us that maps are not always perfectly descriptive, they can have normative aspects too.<br />
The organigram isn’t just a way to represent the people. It is also a way to explain how they <em>should</em> interact. We can also have maps that are not "a map of something". For example, I might devise an abstract game in my mind. Let’s take chess. It is perfectly possible to play chess only within your mind without using physical representations. When doing so "the king in E1" refers to a part of the map that is the instance of the game of chess in our mind. It is not a modelization of reality.<br />
A specificaly interesting example is the case of fiction. When I say "doctor Mcninja punched a dinosaur" <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> one might be tempted to say "no, there is a a fiction story that depicts a nonreal universe in which a person called Dr Mcninja punched a dinosaur". But then you are tempted to answer "that’s obviously what he meant". <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> It is said that confusing map and territory is a fallacy. It is called the reification fallacy <a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> and the wikipedia page directly mentions the "map and territory" thing. I would say the answer is that we think in the context of maps all the time and that the reification fallacy occurs when we confuse the maps. So there is nothing wrong with me saying "doctor Mcninja punched a dinosaur", but there is a problem if I think and act as if I had said that in the context of a map of reality.<br />
So we have maps of maps, which can create towers of maps. We can build additional towers and we can split them (looks like a fork) and join them (reverse fork). Towers can take "reality" as their basis, but they can also "just start on nothing". For a more detailed construction, please refer to chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>.<br />
An important notion is that within those towers of maps we build, only the top layers really matter to our understanding. Of course it’s not like the bottom has no effect. After all, the truth of many statements depends on reality, which sits at the bottom more often than not. But it’s more that we can replace a given bottom layer with a different but structuraly equivalent one and still get similar effects near the top. If you suddenly learn that all of the universe is contained inside a simulation, that doesn’t affect your ability to discuss your favorite food. In a way we might say that as long as we only think within our mind the "reality" layer of the tower doesn’t exit. It’s more that there is a tower of maps inside your mind that is connected to reality. But reality is irrelevant to the thinking process in itself.<br />
Not only is the idea of maps and people thinking within the context of maps useful to understand how we think and avoid fallacies, I would say it is a useful notion to understand the minds of others. When we disagree with people, we might simply disagree on precise and clear identifiable statements. But we can also be thinking using different maps. One of us might be using "correct" maps and not the other. If that is the case, the former is "right" to some extent. But that doesn’t mean we can track the essence of the disagrement and of the error of the later in the surface level statements on which the conflict tends to focus. The differences on the maps we use is but a part of the differences between two people’s perspectives, a notion I will introduce shortly in chapter <a href="#ChapPerspective" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapPerspective">19</a>. <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a><br />
In this chapter I used the word "map" a lot. But the corresponding general notion I use is called "ideoplex" (first refered to in chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>). Ideoplexes are themselves the correspondents within a human mind of the more abstract notion of kirkinplex, which were introduced in chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>. Kirkinplexes benefit from being introduced in a more formal context, allowing a better construction of the general notions presented here. Chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a> isn’t needed here. But to go deeper on the topic than I do in this chapter I use the notions of ideoplex and kirkinplex. Besides, I will use the word "ideoplex" instead of "map" everywhere except in this chapter.<br />
Finaly, a small disclaimer, separated from the rest. The notion of map used here is but a model of how humans think, a description. I think it is a good one, the kind that feels natural and "obvious" once you understand it. But I can be wrong, and even if I am not it is not a perfect model. I would say it is mostly a model of our nominal thinking. In the end, the best description of a human is certainly simply a complexe, mechanical, unsatisfying one.</p>
<p>Also, nothing in this chapter says that we can freely choose our maps. We do, but only to a certain extent. And I am not saying that you can think anything without any link with reality just because you say so. This is a model, not a technical specification for humans. You are a thinking machine that simply behaves as it is poised to behave. I am modelizing a part of that behavior as described above because I find that it is often correct and is compatible with my own internal perception of self as such a thinking machine.</p>
