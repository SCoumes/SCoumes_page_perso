<h1 id="ChapDiffThought">Communicating with alien thinkers</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter admits the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a></p></li>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="#ChapRigorCogi" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorCogi">14</a></p></li>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="#ChapRigorGene" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapRigorGene">15</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>However they are all weak requirements and the chapter can roughly be read without them.<br />
Estimated need for active reading : <span class="math inline"> ⋆  ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="foreword-3">Foreword</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I explore some issue that can arise when trying to value and incorporate the ideas of others into my owns. These are, in a way, theoretical objections to me incorporating their thoughts as a part of a "cooperative thinking effort".<br />
The main goal of this chapter is to identify these issues and seek solutions. I consider two main categories for these issues. Those that pretend to rob the other’s ideas of their value, and those that hinder communication and the exchange of ideas.<br />
I have in the past found it difficult to decide how to consider the ideas of others around these issues. In that regard, this chapter can be seen as an attempt to improve in that regard. Notably, I am trying to find ways to be less dismissive about the thought of others when the issues arise (dismissing ideas is simple universal solution).<br />
This chapter will first list possible differences between different mind’s thinking process. Then, I will attempt to show the issues and how they can create the problems they do. Once that is done, I will explain how the two categories of problems can be solved (value and communication). The conclusion section is a little off topic and talks quickly about good way to think.</p>
<h2 id="ChapDTsecVari">The ways human thoughts can vary</h2>
<p>It is clear that the way a human think can differ from the way of another in more than a single way. As future sections of this chapter will discuss how human thoughts can have value beyond the difference between them, future me and future you will be glad if I now spend some time on the description of what these differences can be. Because you and I might be one and the same, I am extra motivated by the opportunity to make myself double glad; great motivation.</p>
<h3 id="concept-introduction-thought-patterns">Concept introduction : thought patterns</h3>
<p>First, I need to introduce yet <em>another</em> handy concept. If you read the previous chapters in order, then you probably noticed I did that a lot. I am sorry, but this one should be intuitive, and quick to describe, and it is named in normal English.<br />
</p>
<div id="ChapDTdefTP" class="defi">
<p><strong>Definition 17.1</strong> (Thought pattern).  <em>A thought pattern is a specific pattern of thought that can be adopted by a human and adapted to various situations. Its a structural property of thought. They might also simply be called "a way to think".</em></p>
</div>
<p>In the model of the human mind from chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>, a thought pattern tends to correspond to one or more subprocesses. However, a thought pattern can for example also correspond to how such a bundle of subprocesses operates in a specific context (stressful situations for example). <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a><br />
A thought pattern that was theorized and described and that one uses consciously is called a thought protocol.</p>
<h3 id="the-differences">The differences</h3>
<p>And now, time to make a non-exhaustive-but-hopefully-somewhat-good list of ways for two human’s string of thoughts on a given subject to be different. I am only concerned here by difference that seem fit to create a wedge between the humans that prevents the exchange of thoughts. Actually, I am mostly interested by differences that seem fit to dampen or cancel my potential interest in the thoughts of another.</p>
<p>Notably, this means that I am not interest of differences that amount to "we had different sudden ideas". Anyway, here is a list :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We can have (or use) different thought patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>We can have different beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p>We can place our thoughts on the subject in different overarching models.</p></li>
<li><p>There can be differences in other "mind setup" variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Case 1 should be clear if you understood definition <a href="#ChapDTdefTP" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapDTdefTP">Definition 17.1</a>. Case 2 should be intuitive in general. Case 3 refers to my notion of models and their use by human minds. they are discussed in chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a>. Alternatively, if you have read chapter <a href="#ChapTruth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruth">2</a>, you can simply think "a model is to an idea what a kirkinplex is to a kirkin, except models aren’t always ideas themselves". <span> When the chapter on semantic is complete, refer to it instead.</span> As for case 4, it also uses the model from chapter <a href="#ChapHumanMind" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapHumanMind">9</a> mind but can be explained without it. The idea is that minds can have various parameters, set to some "values" (which are by default not numbers). A good example would be "base emotional position on topic X".</p>
<h2 id="ChapDTsecIssues">The expected issues</h2>
<p>There are different ways in which I would expect differences between the ways people think to be problematic. Some of them are symmetrical and rely only on the existence of a difference of a certain kind. These should be possible between very large numbers of pairing of people.</p>
<p>Others are more personal. They are about differences between me and many others in my society. They however are not "perfectly" personal. I believe considerations about them can be useful to many people.</p>
<h3 id="their-lack-of-meaning">Their lack of meaning</h3>
<p>I have an intuition that it should be very problematic when exchanging ideas if the other’s thoughts fail from a semantical standpoint. In other words, in this intuition, a failure to create sufficient meaning should mean we cannot incorporate the thoughts of the other in our owns.<br />
This mostly comes from a requirement for sufficient wogian rigor imposed on my own thoughts. However this can also pertain to another effect that is the topic of section <a href="#ChapDTsecUnder" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapDTsecUnder">17.4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="incompatibilities">Incompatibilities</h3>
<p>It seems intuitive that the various ways for thoughts to be different listed in section <a href="#ChapDTsecVari" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapDTsecVari">17.2</a> can be ground for incompatibilities. Sometimes, a large difference might simply require a lot of time to be bridged, because a lot must be said. The possibility also remains that there be issues that cannot be resolved with "just" enough time, because of other problems and incompatibilities.<br />
Anyway, the idea here is that there can be ideas that cannot be incorporated because they are "too alien".</p>
<h3 id="their-lack-of-intent">Their lack of intent</h3>
<p>This problem might feel a little off topic. Sometimes, I am confronted that people are invested on a topic, care about the result and decide to make their stance on the topic important to who they are or what they do, and yet are willing to spend very little effort on getting the answer right, compared to me. That effort could notably take the form of time spent on the topic or willingness to go through boring or annoying phase of thought.<br />
When I myself have made such efforts and believe I have found knowledge on the topic that they have not because of their lack of effort, it creates a tendency to dismiss further contributions they can make on the topic.</p>
<h3 id="their-bad-protocols">Their bad protocols</h3>
<p>Maybe this should simply count as a form of incompatibility, but I desired to make it stand out. There can be an issue with the thoughts of others being structured with thought patterns I disapprove. In such a case there is yet again a tendency to dismiss the thoughts, for the sequence they form cannot be incorporated as it stands.</p>
<h2 id="ChapDTsecUnder">An observed problem with understanding</h2>
<p>In this section, I attempt to understand why differences in the way thoughts are formed can cause an inability to understand the thoughts of others. Once again, I am not interested by other ways to lack understanding. I am especially not interested by notions such as "lack of knowledge" or "slower mind". Hence, I assume that these issues are not present in the situations to which these considerations apply.</p>
<h3 id="context-my-personal-experience-with-physics-in-cpge">Context : my personal experience with physics in CPGE</h3>
<p>A CPGE, which is a french acronym for "Classe Preparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles", is a formation in two year which prepares for contests used in France to dispatch students into the "great schools" system. I myself spend three years in one of those, retaking the second year, in order to get my contest for the computer science school I am now in. My formation was specialized in math, but also contained a hefty amount of physics (and very little computer science).<br />
I noticed a strange effect : the more I understood math and became rigorous, the less I was able to understand my physics lesson. These lessons, and actually the approach to physics presented, were much less rigorous than my math lessons (in the sense of wogian rigor). And as I myself understood rigor more and more, I started to feel a growing feeling of disconnection with what my physics professor said <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> . I could see the mistakes, untold approximations and sometimes outright lies and misused concepts. And even though these were mostly benign when you looked at them, I simply could not look past them. To a lesser extent, that would have felt like trying to look past the fact that a book is written in old Sumerian <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>.</p>
<p>You might think I am deluding myself and that my lack of understanding was caused by something else. That is a possibility, and I do not entirely exclude the idea that I actually suffered from a lack of motivation caused by a form of repressed disdain in the face of the mistakes I could spot. But that is not really an issue. If you agree that the situation I described can exist then we have a topic to discuss, regardless of whether or not I was such a case. For the rest of the chapter, I will assume that was so.<br />
The following subsections will consider how different thought constructions can cause a lack of understanding. The case of my physics lessons is used, but the section is not strictly restricted to it.</p>
<h3 id="different-thought-patterns">Different thought patterns</h3>
<p>A first idea is that different thought patterns are not compatible with each others. Because sometimes the communication of ideas requires to create a cogitation in the mind of the other that is similar to the one occurring in our own mind, different protocols could cause communication issues. When you do not have the right protocols you might be incapable of following the other’s line of thoughts in the same way he does.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that you cannot reify the other’s line of thought, understanding how he thinks. But that is a more difficult and costly procedure than simply thinking the thoughts in the order a similar mind presents them.<br />
When I became more rigorous I did not create entirely new protocols, the ancient one progressively evolved. Specifically, they evolved to require more wogian rigor. It might simply be then that I could no longer run the cogitations as they were presented by my teacher because I not longer had protocols to handle that kind of ideas without my new level of wogian rigor.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is still my main theory. I think it is an important idea.</p>
<h3 id="thought-patterns-no-longer-working">Thought patterns no longer working</h3>
<p>A variation on the previous idea is that sometimes some thought patterns cease to work in certain contexts, especially depending on beliefs we have. This serves to explain how acquiring knowledge, without fundamentally changing the structure of our minds, can bare us from understanding certain things.<br />
For example, the realization that a concept is absurd can suddenly make us unable to get the same feeling of understanding of the idea we previously had. I would say that happened to me with the popular notion of duty.</p>
<p>In that case, I would attempt an explanation by saying that we use protocols that are not meant to explicitly handle absurdities and "fail" <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> when they detect one.</p>
<h3 id="overarching-models">Overarching models</h3>
<p>Thirdly, a difference in the models providing context for the thoughts can cause an inability to understand the idea proposed by the other. It is simply that the explanations need to start at a lower level, to rebuild more.</p>
<h3 id="fake-understanding">Fake understanding</h3>
<p>I take this chance to talk about the notion of "fake understanding". The idea is simple : sometimes, we have ideas that are much more meaningless than we believe. When that is the case, we can get the feeling that normally comes with understanding in an illegitimate fashion.</p>
<p>After all, if that were not possible then the feeling of understanding would be a very good test for quality of meaning.<br />
I am not pretending that was what happened to my physics teacher; or perhaps only to some lesser extent, as I would say it happens quite often to everyone. However, now seemed like a good time to drop this idea.</p>
<h2 id="finding-value">Finding value</h2>
<p>During my reflection on this chapter, I have found reasons to seek and hope for value in the thoughts of others beyond the issue I have discussed above. Overall, what follows is a list of reasons the thoughts of people can have somewhat direct value even when they are formed in ways I have decided to ban from my own thoughts.<br />
The moral of this section could be approximated as follows. "The minds of others that operate under the conditions I find unacceptable for myself or without the beliefs I use as foundations can provide intellectual value. Such value goes beyond the possibility to mine others for information and inspiration. It can be value of the kind given to thoughts I produce myself.""</p>
<h3 id="structural-similarities">Structural similarities</h3>
<p>When I say "others", I am by default talking about other members of my own species. Often, they are members of the same society and have a similar culture, perhaps even a similar social background. It is thus reasonable to say that we are "designed" <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> in a similar fashion. We have adapted for tasks and immediate goals that are at least somewhat similar. This places a shared constraint on how our minds work.<br />
I would say this is likely to produce some structural meta-similarities between our ways of thought. When not, I would in turn say that it is likely that we have different ways to have some common qualities which are more general than the direct abilities we exhibit and are in turn high level structural meta-similarities. Hence even if the mental framework of the other is very different from mind, it is likely to have a measure of value for the considerations that are important to my own framework.</p>
<p>Of course, this effect is reduced when what interests me is far removed from what the other’s framework normally handles. Also, this effect is increasingly reduced as my thoughts distance themselves from the common standard normally shared with the other.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-protocols-are-chosen-for-qualities">Thoughts protocols are chosen for qualities</h3>
<p>Thought patterns can be more or less adapted to situations. They have qualities and drawbacks, which can be weighted when choosing between them. A classic example might be "quick thinking or safe thinking?"</p>
<p>The fact that I have decided to use some patterns and not some others, even if we are to assume that I chose well, does not imply that those of others are worthless for what I intend to accomplish. There can be other valid thought patterns to use.<br />
The way I myself think imperfectly is of the same kind as the way others think imperfectly. It is not a matter of making mistake versus having meaningless thoughts. Or at least, not always. Of course, there is still a possibility for a jump between quantitative differences (incremental improvements on thoughts) and qualitative differences (better thought patterns with new exciting qualities).</p>
<h3 id="beyond-meaninglessness">Beyond meaninglessness</h3>
<p>Different thought patterns can have different meaning requirements. Hence, what I see in the other as a problematic lack of meaning might be sufficient for his own thought patterns. This does not automatically imply that the thought patterns used by the others are inferior.</p>
<h3 id="a-word-of-caution">A word of caution</h3>
<p>This chapter gives reason to hope for value in the thoughts of others beyond some causes for pessimism I have listed and that caused me to reject <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> the thoughts of some in the past. This does not mean that these are never good reasons to dismiss the thoughts of others. Mostly, there is a question of context and details.</p>
<h2 id="making-communication-work">Making communication work</h2>
<p>In situations in which the potential for value (potentially of a a measure and likeness similar to my own or beyond) has been established it can be interesting to find solutions to some issues. These are the issue listed in section <a href="#ChapDTsecIssues" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapDTsecIssues">17.3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="diversifying-my-thought-patterns">Diversifying my thought patterns</h3>
<p>If the thought patterns of others are interesting and have qualities that mine do not have, then it can be of interest to incorporate them in my owns. This can specifically be done through the creation of though protocols.<br />
Of course, many thought patterns open a large breach to mistakes and bad intellectual practices. This implies that the incorporation of the other’s thought pattern will often require a degree of containment. Defenses must be lowered to think in a different (and potentially risky) fashion before the main line of thoughts is resumed, hopefully uncorrupted but with additional knowledge and hindsight.</p>
<p>A good metaphor would be the process known as a virtual machine <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> in computer science.</p>
<h3 id="abandoning-perfect-collaboration">Abandoning perfect collaboration</h3>
<p>I can let go of the basic implicit idea that I am talking with the other to produce a collaborative thought construction. Indeed, that assumption makes me judge the thoughts presented as if they were to be my owns. When that idea is abandoned it becomes easier to simply exchange ideas rather than thought processes. That way, small ideas can be given and received independently of the issues that arise at a larger scale.<br />
This also allows to collaboratively build a thought construction that is interesting even if it would be unacceptable for my own private thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="reification-of-parts-of-the-others-mind">Reification of parts of the other’s mind</h3>
<p>When possible I can always build an abstraction for myself that considers the other’s mind as an object. This is a costly procedure but it allows understanding of the interaction without any sacrifice in term of my own intellectual integrity. Still, an abstraction that contains the other’s mind require a modelization. Intensifying the need for modelization of my interlocutor increases the risk for a different kind of failure and mistake.</p>
<h2 id="a-first-few-words-on-good-thought-patterns">A first few words on good thought patterns</h2>
<p>A great deal of what is said in this chapter might give the impression that I am exclusively talking of situations in which I am the one with the "best" thought patterns. That is false with a hint of truth.</p>
<p>What I said above applies to situations in which the other is by no mean "obviously inferior" and can indeed apply for cases where I am the one that is "obviously inferior". However, it is truth that my intuition and need to consider the topic largely stem from experiences (frequent over a large period of time) in situations in which I consider I was the one with "largely better" thought patterns.<br />
In this last section, I will say a few words about which kind of thought patterns I consider to be better. Hopefully, I will later write much more on that topic.<br />
As a rule of thumb, I tend to consider that thought patterns are better when they use meaningful ideas, when they use complete models rather than incomplete ones, when they produce coherent ideas, and when they are tunal.<br />
I will attempt to give a few justifications about tunality. Overall, I would say that because tunality gives us control, it gives us the possibility to optimize our own thoughts. In that regard, tunal thought patterns are not intrinsically better, it’s just that they have a lot of potential. I would however also say that when we are using tunal approaches we tend to naturally avoid a large number of bad behaviors.</p>
