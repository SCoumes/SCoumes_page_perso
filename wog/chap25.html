<h1 id="ChapFlawsMain">Flaws : introduction and divers</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter has no requirements.</p>
<p>Estimated need for active reading: <span class="math inline"> ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="explanations">Explanations</h2>
<p>This chapter serves as the entry point to the "flaws" series of chapters. The idea is to list different mental flaws a human can exhibit. What is a flaws and how do I choose the ones I talk about ?<br />
A mental flaw is a bad pattern of thought, with regard to a standard I have on how one should think in the circumstances in which the pattern is deployed. To qualify, the flaw must mostly be "self contained" and explainable. One should be able to react to the flaw and think about it as a single "thing".</p>
<p>So a flaw is a flaw with regard to my estimation of how what is a good way to think and what isn’t. This notion of flaw is vague and the limit is quite blurry. What some might see as a flaww to be listed in theses chapters I might decide to examine separtely as its own topic.<br />
I do not intent to list all possible flaws within the human mind. That would be both extremely time consuming and doomed to fail. So how will I choose which ones to write about ? Mostly I care about the flaws I can spot within my own mind. I care about my flaws because I want to correct them. More precisely, I will write about the flaws within me that I judge problematic enough. I might still decide to discuss and other possible flaw I think I managed to avoid or do not care about enough to correct.</p>
<p>If I do so then it probably means I decided it was interesting for a specific reason that I will include in te relevant entry.<br />
Entries ? Chapters ? How does this works ? A string of chapters grouping flaws by category then a section per flaw, called an entry. Beyond this introductory section, the following sections in this chapter act as the entries for the "others" category. Now that you have read this, you can consider the reading order among the "flaws" chapters as completely random.</p>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>tendency want a perfect model and correct/dislike reality</p></li>
<li><p>lack acceptance ppl have different goals</p></li>
<li><p>perseverance turning into obstination</p></li>
<li><p>obsessiveness over my ideas of the time</p></li>
<li><p>Letting the fact that someone is supposed to do something act as moral reassurance that it is done, even if know isn’t</p></li>
<li><p>Being proud of having beautiful ideas makes it harder to discard them</p></li>
<li><p>I approach problem as if they were structuraly meant to be solved "using what was given"</p></li>
<li><p>Reject humanity of those who do not respect models</p></li>
<li><p>tendency to let rejection of ideas harden the feeling of certainty granted by eventual acceptation</p></li>
<li><p>Feel the need to be blameless to have the right to blame others</p></li>
<li><p>Tendency to aspire to greatness for self justification</p></li>
<li><p>Increased leniency for the enemy of the enemy</p></li>
<li><p>tendency tolerate what I enjoy, even in societal views</p></li>
