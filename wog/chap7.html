<h1 id="ChapTruthDiscussion">Truth : discussion and conclusion</h1>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>This chapter is a part of the string of chapters describing the theory of truth based on kirkins. They are meant to be read linearly. If you have not already, read chapter <a href="#ChapTruthEntry" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ChapTruthEntry">[ChapTruthEntry]</a> first.</p>
<p>Estimated need for active reading: <span class="math inline"> ⋆ ⋆</span></p>
</div>
<p>Some of the choices made in the above presented model require a degree of justification. The presentation of the model was not made jointly with an explanation of the ideas behind its construction. However, I believe some specific points are worth explaining separately, both to raise attention to the fact that a choice had to be made and to explain the final decision.</p>
<h2 id="existence-of-non-absolute-truth">Existence of non-absolute truth</h2>
<p>The first such choice is the choice to use a correspondence model with varying degrees of definition and truth. At first, I was presented with two conflicting intuitions. It seemed to me that absolute truth had to be constructed in an human independent fashion because there are facts that seem to be independent of the existence of humans. However, it also seemed to me that partial truth was best considered a human notion. After all, some truth are only comparable within the context of an ill defined human intuition. How then could it be considered as having a separate existence ?<br />
I chose to consider everything as having the same degree of existence, presented as human independent in the model. However, I am conscious that in doing so the notion of truth presented has to be at least somewhat relative. I consider the model to be presenting itself as absolute. In other words, the model simply "is" and does not offer ways to discuss its change. I simply consider that the model describes a notion of truth, and that the notion of truth used by a specific human can be different to that of an other human. However, I also consider that most "right" notions of truth fit the presented model at least somewhat.</p>
<h2 id="additional-properties">Additional properties</h2>
<p>Provided that truth fits the model presented, the details of how the function T works are still vague. One might notice that as is, it is perfectly possible to choose <span class="math inline"><em>T</em>(<em>x</em>) = ⊤</span> for all <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> without encountering any issue with the presentation of the model. My current answer is that many properties seem implicit regarding <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span>. My reason not to list them in the model description is that even though many things feel obvious in general, I struggle to give them a satisfying formulation to express as a characteristic of <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span>. Hence, I will simply say that <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> mostly behaves "at least as is obvious, when it has an obvious behavior".</p>
<h2 id="lattice">Lattice</h2>
<p>One might wish to question my choice to use a bounded lattice to rate the degrees of truth and meaningfulness. Well, sometimes the degree of truth of two elements are incomparable. Therefore, I needed a poset and not simply a totally ordered set such as <span class="math inline">[0; 1]</span>. To represent absolute truth and falsehood the poset had to be bounded. Beyond that, choosing a lattice rather than just any poset was a choice I made to have access to the properties of section <a href="#intTruth01" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="intTruth01">[intTruth01]</a>. These property appear desirable, but I am not certain that a better structure can not be found. Notably, using a structure that allows to define the complement of any element might prove useful. I however leave such modifications to future developments. It seemed obvious that there should be any number of intermediary levels between any two levels, and so I simply added that property as a supplement property of the lattice.</p>
<h2 id="inelegance">Inelegance</h2>
<p>I have developed a feeling that a better formalism exists that would make much of the elements I introduce pointless, expressing the different characteristics I evaluate precisely in a single mathematical construction. I did not find it, if it does exist.</p>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>Ideas are not present in this model. They are seen as the correspondents in human minds of kirkins, but ideas and kirkins are still different entities. However, the beginning of the informal presentation of the model allows itself to use the word "idea" instead of "kirkin", in order to convey the general idea in advance. Overall, we deem it an acceptable form of language abuse in most situations to speak of an "idea" instead of a "kirkin".</p>
<h2 id="probability">Probability</h2>
<p>The notion of probability (or indeed even randomness) is not part of the model as the model does not feature evolution of its prime components. Instead, any given model of probability has to be presented as a kirkinplex. It bears reminding here that the model is a model of truth and meaning, not of language or thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="a-small-comment">A small comment</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that the model of truth presented here is itself a kirkinplex withing itself.</p>
<h2 id="overall-quality-of-the-model">Overall quality of the model</h2>
<p>The question is worth asking : what is the point of such a model as it stands ? Even though the model is lacking in precision and completeness on different points, I believe it can be somewhat useful. I see that model as a way to clarify the fundamental for other future reflections of higher levels. A goal of the model is to give an end to the process of recursive deconstruction when trying to be rigorous.</p>
