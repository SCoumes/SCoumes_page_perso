      <h1> Hello my name is <strong>Simon Coumes</strong> </h1>
      <p>
				I am a 22 years old second year student in the computer Science Departement of the ENS Rennes.
			 	I am interested by many subjects, both applied and theoritical.
			 	Mainly, I like to think if not in rigorous terms then at least with clearly understood limitations.
				Understanding the  semantic context in which we work is, in my opinion, of great help when things get hard.
				For that reason, I almost always deem it worthy to invest the time to do so.

		<h3> Something I would like to show </h3>
		<p>
			During the current sabatical, I am working on a string of various reflections aiming to consolidate my general views of "important things".
			I am currently still focussing on the very fundamental stuff, which I bellieve is required for me to move on to more applied topics later. <br/>
			I welcome any feedback and I use <a href="http://sl4.org/crocker.html"> Crocker's rule </a> on demand, though not by default. <br />
