						<h2> Quick presentation </h2>
			      <p>
			        I am currently taking a year long sabatical to work on a string of various reflections aiming to consolidate my general views of "important things".

			        <br> <br>
			        I write my reflexions and used to have a regularly updated public version avaialble here (mainly intended as easy access for my friends and relatives). But I have not updated it recently and am nearing the end of the project and final writing phase anyway. Because I am not satisfied by anything I have in writing right now, I intend to leave this page as is until the end of the project.
							I expect a public version to be available by fall 2021.
			      </p>

						<h2> This is a work in progress </h2>
			      <p>
			        Even the last version made available is only a work in progress.
			        My writing notes are visible in purple, and anything I wrote is still succeptible to change in the future if I decide to rework it or if I rethink about what is said.
							<br>
							I am currently focusing on paper notes for my reflections. However, I intend to type my notes and update this page with them in the coming weeks.
			        <br> <br>
			        If you dislike anything you see in my writing then I am interested, please tell me why.
			        I welcome any feedback and I use <a href="http://sl4.org/crocker.html"> Crocker's rule </a> on demand, though not by default.

						<h2> wogian ? </h2>
			      <p>
			        "Wog" or "wogian" is a word I made up to refer to my current reflexions.
			        Sometimes, I use "wogian" as an adjective to add in front of things I want to clarify without looking like I am trying to correct everyone.
			        It's convenient for me, nothing more.
