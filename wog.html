      <h2> Quick presentation </h2>
      <p>
        I am currently taking a year long sabatical to work on a string of various reflections aiming to consolidate my general views of "important things".
        As of now, I am still focusing on the very fundamental stuff, which I believe is required for me to move on to more applied topics later.

        <br> <br>
        I write my reflexions down in a companion document, which is supposed to offer a summary of the views I arrive at.
        This document is public, for whoever is interested. You can find the last version <a href="downloadables/Wogian.pdf"> here </a>.
        If you want the LaTEX source, the public git repository is <a href="https://github.com/SCoumes/Wog"> here </a>.
      </p>

      <h2> This is not a book </h2>

			<p>
				I know I am presenting a single monlithic pdf, split into thematical chapters and with formating similar to that of a normal book.
				But it is not meant to be read linearly, there is no forced unity of subject, and not eveything is approached from the same perspective.
				In a way, my intent is closer to that of a research diary than of a book.
				<br> <br>
				I have tried to make it easy to choose what to read and I intend to improve that more in the future.
				In the meantime, please feel free to read what you like as if this were a blog.
				I have spared you my "completely off topic" reflexions, but different chapters still broach vastly different subjects.
			</p>

			<h2>So why is this a single pdf ?</h2>

			<p>
				Two answers: LaTEX and printing.
				I am not entirely satisfied with LaTEX but it is the best way to make documents I know.
				And LaTEX makes pdfs.
				I thought about writing pure html or using markdown, but I decided against it.
				One reason to avoid pure html is my desire to have the final product be printable.
				Formating might have been an issue if I chose another path, so I decided to stick with LaTEX.

      <!-- <p>
        For various reasons, I decided to let my writing take the form of a single pdf document.
        This has the drawback of presenting what I do as a single intimidating monolith, which isn't something I want.
        Please, do feel free to simply take a look at the chapters you like.
        Think each chapter as a single independent entry, talking about a given topic.
        If a chapter requires to read something else first, then it will be written at the begining.
        I however do recommend to read the introduction.
      </p> -->

      <h2> This is a work in progress </h2>
      <p>
        Even the last version made available is only a work in progress.
        My writing notes are visible in purple, and anything I wrote is still succeptible to change in the future if I decide to rework it or if I rethink about what is said.
        <br> <br>
        If you dislike anything you see in my writing then I am interested, please tell me why.
        I welcome any feedback and I use <a href="http://sl4.org/crocker.html"> Crocker's rule </a> on demand, though not by default.

      <h2> wogian ? </h2>
      <p>
        "Wog" or "wogian" is a word I made up to refer to my current reflexions.
        Sometimes, I use "wogian" as an adjective to add in front of things I want to clarify without looking like I am trying to correct everyone.
        It's convenient for me, nothing more.
