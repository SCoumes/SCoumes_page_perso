      <h2> Quick presentation </h2>
      <p>
        I am currently taking a year long sabatical to work on a string of various reflections aiming to consolidate my general views of "important things".
        As of now, I am still focusing on the very fundamental stuff, which I believe is required for me to move on to more applied topics later.

        <br> <br>
        I write my reflexions down in a companion document, which is supposed to offer a summary of the views I arrive at.
        This document is public, for whoever is interested. You can find the last version <a href="downloadables/Wogian.pdf"> here </a>.
        If you want the LaTEX source, the public git repository is <a href="https://github.com/SCoumes/Wog"> here </a>.
      </p>

      <h2> Read as you see fit </h2>
      <p>
        For various reasons, I decided to let my writing take the form of a single pdf document.
        This has the drawback of presenting what I do as a single intimidating monolith, which isn't something I want.
        Please, do feel free to simply take a look at the chapters you like.
        Think each chapter as a single independent entry, talking about a given topic.
        If a chapter requires to read something else first, then it will be written at the begining.
        I however do recommend to read the introduction.
      </p>

      <h2> This is a work in progress </h2>
      <p>
        Even the last version made available is only a work in progress.
        My writing notes are visible in purple, and anything I wrote is still succeptible to change in the future if I decide to rework it or if I rethink about what is said.
        <br> <br>
        If you dislike anything you see in my writing then I am interested, please tell me why.
        I welcome any feedback and I use <a href="http://sl4.org/crocker.html"> Crocker's rule </a> on demand, though not by default.

      <h2> wogian ? </h2>
      <p>
        "Wog" or "wogian" is a word I made up to refer to my current reflexions.
        Sometimes, I use "wogian" as an adjective to add in front of things I want to clarify without looking like I am trying to corect everyone.
        It's convenient for me, nothing more.
