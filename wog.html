						<h2> Quick presentation </h2>
			      <p>
							Last year (2020/2021), I took a sabatical to study several topics of interest to me, aiming to consolidate my general views of "important things".

			        <br> <br>
			        I wrote down most of my reflections on many topic and used to have a regularly updated public version available here. But I took it down at some point and have not yet produced a new public version to my satisfaction. I intend to do so in some form or other when I have time to do so. Because I am currently sitting on a 200 pages document, this will probably not happen until summer 2022.

						<h2> This is a work in progress </h2>
			      <p>
			        Even the last version made available is only a work in progress.
			        My writing notes are visible in purple, and anything I wrote is still succeptible to change in the future if I decide to rework it or if I rethink about what is said.
							<br>
							I am currently focusing on paper notes for my reflections. However, I intend to type my notes and update this page with them in the coming weeks.
			        <br> <br>
			        If you dislike anything you see in my writing then I am interested, please tell me why.
			        I welcome any feedback and I use <a href="http://sl4.org/crocker.html"> Crocker's rule </a> on demand, though not by default.

						<h2> wogian ? </h2>
			      <p>
			        "Wog" or "wogian" is a word I made up to refer to this set of reflections.
			        Sometimes, I use "wogian" as an adjective to add in front of things I want to clarify without looking like I am trying to correct everyone.
			        It's convenient for me, nothing more.
