			<h2> Education </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Since 2018 I study computer science at the <strong> ENS Rennes</strong>. </li>
				<li> From 2015 to 2018 I studied in a french CPGE (a kind of intensive school designed to prepare contests) in Lycée Bellevue in Toulouse. </li>
				<li> From 2012 to 2015 I was in high school in Lycée Victor Hugo in Colomier. </li>
			</ul>


			<h2> Research and Teaching </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Since september 2019 I collaborate weekly with team Lacodam in Rennes on the subject of Skyline Querries. </li>
				<li> In summer 2019 I worked with team Lilac in Toulouse on the subject of "Epistemic Logic for IA in the context of games". </li>
				<li> Between 2013 and 2018 I tutored some high school students in mathematics. </li>
			</ul>


			<h2> Programming Languages </h2>

			<h4> Main Languages </h4>
			<p> When I need to write code I almost often resort to the following languages : Python, Ocaml, and LaTEX.
			<br> I am aware that LaTEX is not a programing language per say, let's just say it is still code. </p>

			<h4> Previously used </h4>
			<p> I used the following languages several times each but never enough to consider myself proeficient with them :
			SQL, C, C++, Java, NuSMV, COQ, HTML, and CSS.
			<br> On the subject of HTML and CSS, I realized the present website entirely by hand. </p>


			<h2> Human languages </h2>
			<p> I am fluent in <strong>French and in English</strong>. I have minimal school level notions of German and Spanish. </p>


			<h2> Notable Elements </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I participated in the SWERC contest both in 2019 and in 2020. The SWERC contest is the demi-finale for the ICPC contest.</li>
				<li>I entered the ENS through the computer science contest without access to the relevant courses and so had to study the necessary material on my own.</li>
				<li> I animate roleplay games and a bi-weekly basis as a part of the ENS Rennes gaming club. </li>
			</ul>
