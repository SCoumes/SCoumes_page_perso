						<h2>Education</h2>
						<ul>
							<li> Since 2018 I study computer science at the <strong> ENS Rennes</strong>. </li>
							<li> From 2015 to 2018 I studied in a french CPGE (a kind of intensive school designed to prepare contests) in Lycée Bellevue in Toulouse. </li>
							<li> From 2012 to 2015 I was in high school in Lycée Victor Hugo in Colomier. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2> Research and Teaching </h2>
						<ul>
							<li> Since september 2019 I collaborate weekly with team Lacodam in Rennes on the subject of Skyline Querries. This has lead to a publication at IWOCA 2021. </li>
							<li> In summer 2019 I worked with team Lilac in Toulouse on the subject of "Epistemic Logic for IA in the context of games". </li>
							<li> Between 2013 and 2018 I tutored some high school students in mathematics. </li>
						</ul>

						<h2> Programming Languages </h2>

						<h4> Main Languages </h4>
						<p> When I need to write code I almost often resort to the following languages : Python, Ocaml, and LaTEX.
						<br> I am aware that LaTEX is not a programing language per say, let's just say it is still code. </p>

						<h4> Previously used </h4>
						<p> I used the following languages several times each but never enough to consider myself proeficient with them :
						SQL, C, C++, Java, NuSMV, COQ, HTML, and CSS.
						<br> On the subject of HTML and CSS, I realized the present website entirely by hand. </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2> Human languages </h2>
						<p> I am fluent in <strong>French and in English</strong>. I have minimal school level notions of German and Spanish. </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2> Notable Elements </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>I participated in the SWERC contest both in 2019 and in 2020. The SWERC contest is the demi-finale for the ICPC contest.</li>
							<li>I entered the ENS through the computer science contest without access to the relevant courses and so had to study the necessary material on my own.</li>
							<li> I animate roleplay games and a bi-weekly basis as a part of the ENS Rennes gaming club. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2> Previous work in computer science </h2>
						<ul>
							<li> As a part of my internship with team Lilac, I wrote an article and devised an epistemic logic. Currently unavailable. </li>
							<li> As a project in the ENS I built simple ray-tracing software for 3D renders. </li>
							<li> I wrote code in OCaml to handle Delaunay triangulation in two dimensions. </li>
							<li> Again for the ENS I made a basic Lisp interpretor in C++. <a href="./downloadables/Lisp.pdf"> Click here to download (in French) </a>. </li>
							<li> I wrote a summary article as a part of the Xtra module for the ENS Rennes. <a href="./downloadables/Octagon_domain.pdf"> Click here to download (in English) </a>. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2> Other previous work </h2>
						<ul>
							<li> A few years ago, I devised a certainty scale to grade my thoughts. Version 2 is under way. <a href="./downloadables/Certainty_scale.pdf"> Click here to download (in English) </a> </li>
							<li> I did what is called a TIPE to enter my school, but I rate the results as mediocre. Please do not <a href="./downloadables/Dossier_tipe_Coumes_Simon.pdf"> click here to download (in French) </a>. </li>
